## 🎯 WHAT THIS MEANS FOR FUTURE SESSIONS

### When Claude Code Starts Next Session:

**It will now:**
1. Read `.claude-session-config.md`
2. Load roadmap-guide files (PART-1, PART-2, INDEX, etc.)
3. Know about institution-centric architecture
4. Know about tech research protocol
5. Know about fluence.ac and fluence.institute domains
6. Know current status: Phase 2, Week 1-2 ready to start
7. Monitor file sizes automatically
8. Use modern-first philosophy for tech decisions

**It will NOT:**
- Miss the new strategic plan
- Try to read oversized files
- Be confused about project direction
- Miss the tech research requirements
