Context: The session begins with a math game on a device, then transitions to an English/Social Studies lesson regarding the chapter "India at Play," covering traditional Indian games like Kho-Kho, Kabaddi, and Chess.

Teacher: All players are selected now?

Student: Nahi sab log nahi hue, kuch do-teen players Ma'am boli ki unko to leke jaungi... [Hindi: No, not everyone. Ma'am said she will take two or three players...]

Teacher: Okay. Aur kuch log baad mein select honge? [Hindi: And some will be selected later?]

Student: Nice.

Teacher: So, you already prepared the class... very well. So... your scores will continue? From here also?

Student: Preparation points will definitely be added for the class.

Teacher: And before starting this class... I want you to try a game.

Student: Hmm.

Teacher: The new math game that I have built. Like, first five minutes like... we'll play it. Then we'll start with the class. Okay?

Student: Hmm.

Teacher: And in English like... what is the status right now? Like... do we have to start everything from zero? Or you have done something? Like... you haven't done anything?

Student: Okay.

Teacher: We will do it. Like... it's not hard because... first Tenses are coming?

Student: Hmm.

Teacher: Which you know I think. Just need to do the exercises... of the chapter of Grammar book. Apart from that you need to do dia... Diary Entry?

Student: Diary entry to aati hai but mereko question answers main lag... [Hindi: I know Diary entry but the question answers I feel...]

Teacher: Bas question answer bacha hai na? Wahi karna hai? [Hindi: Only question answers are left right? That's what we have to do?]

Student: Toh... chalo.

Teacher: Game ko end mein try karein ki shuru mein try karein? [Hindi: Should we try the game at the end or the start?]

Student: Abhi. [Hindi: Now.]

Teacher: Theek hai.

Teacher: So... are you feeling good that the classes are continuing? Or are you feeling bad that, "Oh again tuitions... what is the feeling right now?" Like... are you feeling nice?

Student: Hmm. Very well.

Teacher: So we can do English quiz also... if possible tomorrow. In Kavya's class most probably. Because you... you are still coming late I think? You are still staying back?

Student: Hmm.

Teacher: Okay. So we will do the classes at this time only. 5:15. Have you taken your snacks? Evening snacks? Have you eaten anything?

Student: No.

Teacher: Means have you eaten anything or you are feeling hungry because class will go on for at least one hour fifteen minutes.

Student: Like...

Teacher: So there's no problem?

Student: No.

Teacher: Very good. I think... Anjali Ma'am also takes class... at this time only? Or at 4 o'clock? At what time does she take class usually?

Student: Kaun? Anjali Ma'am? Isi time. [Hindi: Who? Anjali Ma'am? At this time.]

Teacher: Isi time? [Hindi: This time?] Haan to phir to aapke liye koi... jyada difference hai hi nahi. Same cheez jo hoti aayi hai wahi ho rahi hai. Bas teacher koi aur aakar baith gaya. Hai na? [Hindi: Yes, so for you there isn't much difference. The same thing that has been happening is happening. Just a different teacher has come and sat down. Right?]

Teacher: Theek hai. Mujhe sunayi pada Saksham Bhagwat mein pahunch gaya tha chaar din ke liye achanak se? [Hindi: Okay. I heard Saksham suddenly reached the Bhagwat (religious event) for four days?]

Student: Haan. [Yes.]

Teacher: Wo uski profile picture wahi ki hai kya? [Hindi: Is his profile picture from there?]

Student: Haan.

Teacher: Achha. Okay.

Student: First day wo cameraman ko paisa deke aaya tha. [Hindi: First day he gave money to the cameraman.]

Teacher: Achha.

Student: Meri dekhna... focus karna meri photo mein. [Hindi: Look at mine... focus on my photo.]

Teacher: Achha.

Student: Wo aur meri behen ladai kar rahe the... khane ke liye. Maine video banayi hui thi. [Hindi: He and my sister were fighting... for food. I made a video.]

Teacher: Dikha na. [Hindi: Show me.]

Student: Yes, definitely. I'd like to see that. Saksham... matlab wahan se seedhe yahan pahunch gaya Bhagwat sunne ke liye? [Hindi: Saksham... meaning he went straight from there to here to listen to the Bhagwat?]

Student: Masti karne ke liye. [Hindi: To have fun.]

Teacher: Masti karne ke liye actually.

Student: Wahan pe humare saare cousins the na. [Hindi: All our cousins were there.]

Teacher: Yes, yes. Everyone would want that... at such age. Definitely even if I were in place of Saksham... I would have done the same thing. Most probably. Okay.

Teacher: I think you had played 'Math Fall' earlier? This is... this game is a hundred times upgrade of that game. So... let's try. Like... you can choose which kind of questions you want. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division... exponents... or everything. Or just addition and subtraction for now. What do you want?

Student: Subtraction, addition, subtraction.

Teacher: You want to add multiplication, division also?

Student: Like do... addition, subtraction.

Teacher: Addition, subtraction for now. And speed of questions... right now it is at max. I think... you should choose around... 12 I think. This will be good speed for you. Let's make it 13 because you're good in maths. Okay? And let's see... what score you can create. Kavya scored... around 65,000.

Student: Isme? [Hindi: In this?]

Teacher: In this game. This is her score... like streak. 56 is the best streak. This is my score, 1 lakh 37 thousand. Her score is around 65,000. Let's see if you can beat her. 65,000 is her score, okay?

[Sound of game music and sound effects]

Teacher: There will be power-ups also. There will be bosses... as well. Are you able to see those questions?

[Game sounds continue: Beeping and correct answer chimes]

Teacher: Very good. This is a power-up. Shield. You can take this by moving the rocket left or right.

[Game sounds]

Student: Dikh nahi raha. [Hindi: Can't see.]

Teacher: This question is gonna hit the rocket. The lower one. Your one life gone. Again. Only one life left. Fast. Very good.

[Game sounds]

Student: Minus 19.

Teacher: Do you wanna play it again? Or we should move on to English? You wanna play it again? Let's like... decrease the speed a bit. I think... let's make it same as Kavya. But I was also helping Kavya, so you should get around 11. Because you are playing on your own completely. Okay?

[Game music restarts]

Teacher: Well done.

Student: 70...

Teacher: Minus 10.

Student: Isse kya hota hai? [Hindi: What happens with this?]

Teacher: Ye power-up activate ho jayega. Jo 'Q' mein power-up rahega wo activate ho jayega 'Q' dabane se. [Hindi: This power-up will activate. Whatever power-up is in 'Q' will activate by pressing 'Q'.]

[Game sounds]

Student: 5 minus 3... 2.

Teacher: 7, 4 ja? [Hindi: 7, 4's are?]

Student: Minus 1.

Teacher: Minus 2. Minus 1.

[Game Over sound]

Teacher: 30,000. Waise to points double hote hain bas. Wo nuclear power-up abhi nahi tha na. But still... very good. 90 percent accuracy, 30,000. And you did it all on your own. You did not take any help of me. That's a great score. Because with that score I had helped Kavya a lot. You did it on your own. We'll do it again maybe later on. Okay? And we'll see... what... like...

Student: Kavya ne 2 kiya tha? [Hindi: Kavya did 2?]

Teacher: 65,000. Beech beech mein help kar diya tha jahan pe end mein... hard questions aa ja rahe the. Us vajah se. Theek hai. Chalo. Hum aur khelenge ise... baad mein. Aur abhi aate hain English pe. Theek hai?

Teacher: Question answers hi main... hai jo aapko karna hai I think. Hai na? Easy hai. Zyada hard nahi hain question answers.

Student: Maine chapter padha hi nahi aapne... [Hindi: I haven't read the chapter, you...]

Teacher: Likha bhi nahi aapne. Abhi basketball ki wajah se kya? Ki... Bhagwat ki wajah se?

Student: Dono ki wajah se. [Hindi: Because of both.]

Teacher: Wo Madhubani wala hi nahi likha hai kya? [Hindi: You haven't written the Madhubani one either?]

Student: Haan. [Yes.]

Teacher: To aapne seedha hi likh diya kya uske baad mein? [Hindi: So did you write directly after that?]

Student: Haan term 2 ka... [Hindi: Yes, Term 2's...]

Teacher: Nahi iske pehle hona chahiye tha na... Colors of the Earth wala? [Hindi: No, it should have been before this right... Colors of the Earth?]

Student: Haan pehle hona chahiye tha par... [Hindi: Yes, should have been before but...]

Teacher: Wo chapter hi nahi hua waise. Madhubani wala? Chalo koi baat nahi. Theek hai. 'India at Play' jo chapter hai na... wo India ke traditional games ke baare mein hai. Jaise basketball... Basketball India ka traditional game hai?

Student: Nahi hai.

Teacher: To basketball ke baare mein nahi hai. India ke traditional games jaise ki Kho-Kho... Kabaddi... Chess... Kit-Kit... Gilli-Danda.

Student: Kit-Kit kya hota hai? [Hindi: What is Kit-Kit?]

Teacher: Kit-Kit wo kood-kood kar jo khelte hain na aise bachche. [Hindi: Kit-Kit is that one where kids jump and play.] Theek hai? Waise games ke baare mein hai. Clear hai? Itna simple description hi hai chapter ka. Ab ek-ek karke hum question answer dekhte hain.

Teacher: Chalo. To sabse pehle pooch raha hai: Why was Kho-Kho called 'Ratheera' in ancient time? Kho-Kho ko na... ancient time mein kya kehte the?

Student: Ratheera.

Teacher: Ye poochh... bata to raha hai question. Why was Kho-Kho called Rathera in ancient time? To Rathera sunkar kya dimaag mein aa raha hai?

Student: Kuch to...

Teacher: Kuch to aa raha hoga? Rathera mein koi word aapko dikh raha jo aap recognize kar paoge? Rathera ko tod kar dekho kuch.

Student: Run.

Teacher: Kya?

Student: Run.

Teacher: Run? Run to kahin nahi likha hai Rathera mein. Ra... The... Ra. 'Rath' era kuch...

Student: Rath.

Teacher: Rath ek hai na word? Wahi. Rath ke saath khela jaata tha isliye Rathera bolte the. Kho-Kho ko. Kho-Kho khela hai aapne?

Student: Hmm.

Teacher: Aap kaise khelte ho? Daudte rehte ho na aise hi?

Student: Nahi matlab players baithte hain idhar... is taraf... [Hindi: No, meaning players sit here... this side...]

Teacher: Haan phir aise touch kiya phir dauda. Aise hi khelte na? [Hindi: Yes then touched like this then ran. That's how you play right?] Pehle bhi aise hi khelte the bas ye hai players na paidal nahi daudte the. Rath mein daudte the. [Hindi: Earlier they played the same way, only the players didn't run on foot. They ran in Chariots (Raths).]

Student: Rath matlab wo jo ghoda... [Hindi: Rath means that horse...]

Teacher: Haan. Socho kitni badi jagah chahiye hoti hogi... khelne ke liye. Aur jab touch kiya to bhai ghode se dauda ja raha hai. Phir wahan aake wapas rath lag raha hai.

Student: To jo log baithte the unke beech se rath nikal jaate the? [Hindi: So the chariots would go through the people sitting?]

Teacher: Baithte nahi the sab rath mein hi rehte the. [Hindi: They didn't sit, everyone stayed in the chariots.]

Student: Sab hi rath mein? [Hindi: Everyone in chariots?]

Teacher: Haan.

Teacher: So Kho-Kho was called Rathera in ancient times... because it was played on... Raths... or Chariots. Raths ko aur kya kehte hain?

Student: Chariots.

Teacher: Ek copy aur pen le lo jaldi se. Hum likh-likh ke bhi practice karenge question and answers ki. To aapne abhi ye question suna, iska answer bhi suna, ab iska answer aap likh do.

Teacher: Why was Kho-Kho called Rathera in ancient time?
Kho-Kho was called Rathera in ancient times because it was played on Raths or Chariots. Dekh bhi lo ek baar answer ko khud se.

Teacher: Theek hai? Very good. Ab next question pe aate hain. Mahabharata dekhi hai aapne?

Student: Thodi thodi. [Hindi: A little bit.]

Teacher: Chakravyuha ke baare mein pata hai?

Student: Haan pata hai. [Hindi: Yes I know.]

Teacher: Sach mein? Kisko maarne ke liye use kiya gaya tha Chakravyuha ka? [Hindi: Really? Who was it used to kill?]

Student: Dushmano ko? [Hindi: Enemies?]

Teacher: Dushmano ko. Krishna ji haath mein lete the... [Hindi: Lord Krishna used to hold it in his hand...]

Student: Wo to Sudarshan Chakra hai. [Hindi: That is Sudarshan Chakra.]

Teacher: Chakravyuha kya hai? Khair abhi dekhenge. Theek hai. Dekho Chakravyuha na ek position thi army ki. Jo Kauravon ne use kiya tha. Arjun ko jaante ho aap?

Student: Haan. [Yes.]

Teacher: Arjun was... was one of the biggest warriors in the Pandava army. Aur Arjun ke jaisa hi... Arjun ka beta tha, jiska naam tha Abhimanyu. Wo bhi utna hi strong tha. To agar zinda rehte ye dono na... to waise hi poori Kaurav sena khatam hone wali thi. To udhar Kauravon ne, Dronacharya aur logon ne dimaag lagaya ki Abhimanyu ko kisi tareeke se maarna padega. To use maarne ke liye unhone Chakravyuha banaya tha. Kya banaya tha?

Student: Chakravyuha.

Teacher: Aapne dekhi hai Mahabharata wo Star Plus wali? Dekhi hai kya?

Student: Mummy dekh chuki hai do teen baar. Maine thodi thodi dekhi hai. [Hindi: Mummy has watched it two or three times. I have seen a little bit.]

Teacher: Ye dekho, aisa ek army ka position banaya tha unhone. [Shows image/video]. Taaki Abhimanyu ko aisa lage main andar jaata ja raha hoon par wo andar jaakar fasta chala gaya. Aur aisi jagah pahunch gaya jahan se aana hi mushkil ho gaya. Theek hai. Ab question sunna na.

Teacher: Which character in the Mahabharata... is the inspiration... behind the game of Kabaddi? Kabaddi ke game ke peechhe... kaun sa character inspiration hai jo Mahabharata se hai? Kaun hai?

Student: Abhimanyu.

Teacher: Yes. Abhimanyu in the Mahabharata is the inspiration behind the game of Kabaddi. Agar main aapse simply itna question poochhoon... Which character in the Mahabharata is the inspiration behind the game of Kabaddi? To answer kya likhoge aap?

Student: Abhimanyu in the Mahabharata is the inspiration behind the game of Kabaddi.

Teacher: Very good. Ab isi question mein aage likha hai: How is the character an inspiration? Ye character inspiration kaise hai? To ab batayenge hum ise. Theek hai? Chalo. Ab hum bata rahe hain. Abhimanyu get trapped in the Chakravyuha... created by the Kauravas. Pen do. Abhimanyu get trapped in the Chakravyuha... created by the Kauravas.

[Teacher checking student's work]

Teacher: Teacher ne bas itna kyun check kiya? Idhar kyun kuch nahi kiya inhone?

Student: Wo bas check karna... abhi wo submit nahi kar rahi na exam...

Teacher: To main correction kar doon is pen se? [Hindi: So should I correct it with this pen?]

Student: Nahi.

Teacher: Ye galat likha hai Chakravyuha.

Student: Mereko batao. [Hindi: Tell me.]

Teacher: To blue pen hai aapke paas?

Student: Pencil se kar deti hoon. [Hindi: I'll do it with pencil.]

Teacher: To main hi kar doon kya? Achha nahi aap apne handwriting se karoge na? Haan.

Teacher: So Abhimanyu get trapped in the Chakravyuha. Chakravyuha ki spelling... Chakra... C-H-A-K-R.

Student: C-H-A-K-R-A...

Teacher: Chakravyuha. V-Y-U-H.

Student: V-Y-U-H.

Teacher: Chakravyuha. Abhimanyu get trapped in the Chakravyuha created by the Kauravas. Abhimanyu jo hai wo trapped ho jaata hai us Chakravyuha mein jo Kauravas ne banaya tha. Theek hai. Ab aage likha hai: The maneuvers... used by both... ye bhi kuch bhi likh diya aapne. Yahan pe ise kaato aur likho. Main bata raha hoon wo likho. The maneuvers... M-A-N-O...

Student: M-A-N-O...

Teacher: E-U...

Student: E-U...

Teacher: V-R-E.

Student: V-R-E.

Teacher: Maneuvers matlab hota hai kayi prakaar ke moves, actions jo aap use karte ho. Theek hai? Jaise Sage ke maneuvers kaise hote hain? Bilkul skillfully wo defense create karegi, hai na? Heal karegi. To wahi carefully jo skills use karte hain na hum? Use maneuvers bolte hain. So... The maneuvers used by both Abhimanyu... and the Kauravas... against each other... probably inspired... the techniques of... touching and dismissing the opponent...

Teacher: ...as well as controlling breath... and raiding and dodging... in the game of Kabaddi.

Student: Controlling breath... kyun? [Hindi: Controlling breath... why?]

Teacher: Saans rok kar jaate hain na Kabaddi-Kabaddi-Kabaddi bolte hue.

Student: Kabaddi ka rule hi hai na. Yaad karo wo na. Kabaddi khela hai aapne?

Student: To itne saare log honge to ek ghante tak wo maarega to ek ghante tak wo saans rok ke rakha tha? [Hindi: So if there are so many people and he hits for one hour, did he hold his breath for one hour?]

Teacher: Exactly wahi kyun inspired hai aise bol rahe ho aap? Saans rokna kyun inspired hai? Haan aisa kuch nahi hua tha ki usne saans rok kar rakha tha. Exactly saans rokna inspired nahi hai but haan... waisi kuch techniques ka use hua tha. Aise aap samajh sakte ho. Theek hai? To kya kya techniques ko inspire kiya un dono ke maneuvers ne Kauravas aur Abhimanyu ke?

Teacher: The techniques of touching and dismissing the opponent... as well as controlling breath... and raiding and dodging. Raiding aur dodging kya hai? 'Raid' aapne dekha hai na movie wahi wala raid.

Student: Hmm.

Teacher: To raiding kya hota hai jab aap Kabaddi mein jaate ho doosri team ke paas unhe touch karne opponents ko. To aap kya karne gaye ho?

Student: Raiding.

Teacher: Haan raid karne gaye ho. Aur wo log kya karenge? Dodge karenge aapko. Bachne ki koshish karenge. Touch kiya to aise hatenge. So I am dodging you. Koi mujhe aise maar raha hai to main hat raha hoon. I am dodging. Theek hai? To wahi cheez.

Teacher: Abhimanyu get trapped in the Chakravyuha... created by the Kauravas. The maneuvers... aapko khud samajh aata hai aap kya likhte ho? Pakka? Aa jaata hai? Badhka batao to spelling?

Student: M-A-N-O-E-U-V-R-E-S.

Teacher: S bhi laga do. Chalo aapko samajh to aa ja raha hai kam se kam. Mujhe to bilkul nahi aa raha. The maneuvers used by both Abhimanyu... and the Kauravas... against each other... probably inspired the techniques of... touching and dismissing opponents... as well as breath control... reading and dodging in the game of Kabaddi.

Student: Buching kya hota hai? [Hindi: What is Buching?]

Teacher: Kahan?

Student: Techniques of Buching...

Teacher: Touching and dismissing. T-O-U-C-H... T-O-U-C-H. Touching ki spelling hai T-O-U-C-H-I-N-G. Theek hai? Touching and dismissing opponents. Dismissing... D-I-S... or Missing. Use kaat ke side mein likho. Kaat doon?

Student: D-I-S-M-I-S-S-I-N-G.

Teacher: Theek hai.

Woman [Mother/Guardian enters]: Sir isko course kal padha do na? English ke exam mein kyunki... [Hindi: Sir, teach her the course tomorrow? Because for the English exam...]

Teacher: Haan haan wahi question answer hi chal raha hai. Kyunki Tenses to inka pehle hi ho gaya zaroorat bhi nahi hai use karne ki.

Woman: Sir dekhiyega phir last aapko paper dikhaya tha kya isne answer sheet? Ye kya kya mistake ki thi isne? [Hindi: Sir look, did she show you the answer sheet last time? What mistakes she made?]

Student: 58 aaye the usse kam nahi the. [Hindi: It was 58, not less than that.]

Teacher: Grammar, spelling ye saari cheezein hi thi. To abhi to syllabus easy hai. Do chapter hi aa rahe hain. Halaanki usme inka abhi kuch bhi nahi hua hai. Aaj hi hum log start kar rahe hain. Achhi baat hai ki Tense poora ready hai. To ek wo aa raha hai wo inka poora khatam ho gaya.

Woman: Iska revision nahi hua hai? Ye do chapters ka? [Hindi: Her revision isn't done? Of these two chapters?]

Teacher: Ek to chapter hi nahi likha hai inhone copy mein. [Hindi: She hasn't even written one chapter in the copy.]

Woman: Ek chapter hi nahi likha hai tum wo Anjali Ma'am kya karayi hai? Tum nahi padhaati thi? [Hindi: You haven't written a chapter, what did Anjali Ma'am do? Didn't you study?]

Woman: To isko chinta nahi hai ki matlab English ka exam dena hai. Wo to mujhe bolti gayi hai ki maine poora preparation karwa diya hai. [Hindi: So she isn't worried that she has to give an English exam. She (the other teacher) kept telling me that I have done the full preparation.]

Student: Wo Tenses bhi aadha padhai hai. Future tense to padhai nahi hai. [Hindi: She taught half the Tenses too. She didn't teach Future Tense.]

Teacher: Tense to waise aapko zaroorat hi nahi hai. [Hindi: You don't need Tense anyway.]

Student: Haan maine unko bola tha ki Ma'am grammar mein time waste mat karo sir padha chuke hain. Boli nahi main apne side se bhi padhaungi. [Hindi: Yes I told her Ma'am don't waste time on grammar, Sir has taught it. She said no I will teach from my side too.]

Woman: To theory kaun karega to? Bolegi khud karna? [Hindi: So who will do the theory then? Will she say do it yourself?]

Student: Bolegi khud karna. [Hindi: She will say do it yourself.]

Teacher: Khair ho jayega Ma'am. Do chapter hai aaj ek ho jayega, ek kal ho jayega. Easy hai. Tense ho gaya hai uske alawa jo aa raha hai ek Diary Entry hai... bas aur kuch nahi hai syllabus is baar. To ho jayega. Halaanki pehle photo maang ke karna padega.

Woman: To iska work bhi complete nahi hai? [Hindi: So her work isn't complete either?]

Teacher: Haan wo photo maang ke karna padega.

Woman: Work ko poora din bhar khaali ho abhi to sir ki tuition hi rehti hai. Work ko complete kyun nahi karti hai? [Hindi: You are free all day for the work, right now only Sir's tuition is there. Why don't you complete the work?]

Student: Mujhe yaar work complete kyun nahi karti hai. Copy submission thi sabki. [Hindi: Oh man why don't I complete the work. Everyone had copy submission.]

Woman: Sabki copy submit hai... [Hindi: Everyone's copy is submitted...]

Student: Meri bhi submit thi. Correction ke liye gayi hui thi. [Hindi: Mine was also submitted. It had gone for correction.]

Woman: Ye sab excuses hai. [Hindi: These are all excuses.]

Student: Aaj hi mili hai. [Hindi: I got it today only.]

Woman: Abhi sir ki class hone ke baad pehle wo work ko complete karna hai. [Hindi: Now after Sir's class is over, first complete that work.]

Student: Haan theek hai. [Hindi: Yes okay.]

Teacher: Nahi Ma'am aaj balki aap mat karne boliye wo time waste hoga. Copy complete karna. Jaise ho jayega na exam... phir karke likh doge to behtar hai. Kyunki ab time nikal gaya wo copy complete karne ka.

Woman: Sir achha iska thoda sa practice hoga spellings ka... to likh legi na. [Hindi: Sir at least she will get some spelling practice... then she can write.]

Teacher: Mujhe lagta hai bas copy abhi karenge na agar to wo time waste hoga. Behtar hai wo learn kar lena agar dekh kar print kar le. Jaise exam khatam ho jaye phir copy complete kar le to behtar hai. Kyunki ab time nikal gaya wo copy complete karne ka.

Woman: Kab hai English ka exam?

Student: 28.

Teacher: Parso hi hai. Aaj ek chapter hum karenge... ye learn karke practice karengi. Uske baad second jo hai usme se dekh kar ye learn karke practice karengi. Aur tense ke exercises jo book ke hain wo karengi. Agar bas likhne baith jayengi na copy karke to samay waste ho jayega.

Woman: To at least uska xerox to nikalwa lena mangwa ke. [Hindi: Then at least get a xerox of it.]

Teacher: Haan. Aap sochoge na phone se dekh ke padh loongi wo nahi ho payega. Wo photocopy karana padega. [Hindi: Yes. If you think I'll study from the phone, that won't happen. Need to photocopy it.]

Woman: Abhi call karke bol de kisi ko bhejne ke liye, Pawan se uska printout nikalwa leti hoon. [Hindi: Call someone now and tell them to send it, I'll get Pawan to take a printout.]

Teacher: Baaki ho jayega pareshan mat huiye. Aur ye garmi nahi lag rahi sir aap logon ko? [Hindi: Rest will be done don't worry. And aren't you feeling hot Sir?]

Teacher: Mujhe to nahi lag rahi. Aapko lag rahi hai? [Hindi: I'm not feeling it. Are you?]
