(Sound of walking, door knocking)

**Kavya:** Aaiye sir.

**Tutor:** How are you? Actually, today also I'm taking Anaya's class. It will happen day after tomorrow. So your quiz will be conducted day after tomorrow as well, okay? Just taking her brother's class.

**Kavya:** Okay. This was the paper for yesterday’s setting science.

**Tutor:** Okay. So 75 points lost, immediately. You could have solved it yesterday.

**Kavya:** I didn't get the time. In night, I was writing SST.

**Tutor:** Okay. So, did you play the quiz? Quiz done?

**Kavya:** (Nods)

**Tutor:** And preparation is also done. Very nice. So, 100 points. And 75 for science, I think you read the whole chapter. 175 points.

**Kavya:** It should be 250 points... no, 215.

**Tutor:** 175 plus Math Fall and all?

**Kavya:** Yeah, I played.

**Tutor:** Then... It should be 215 because... 225 points. Okay? Math Fall and Spelling Bee, both?

**Kavya:** For sure? Yeah, yeah.

**Tutor:** Very good. Then 225 points I'll be adding. Very close to 19,000 points now. Very good.

**Kavya:** We will not have... the challenge tomorrow?

**Tutor:** Which challenge?

**Kavya:** That only. With Anaya?

**Tutor:** Day after tomorrow, because tomorrow also it will be her brother's class.

**Kavya:** Tomorrow he is going? Her brother?

**Tutor:** He's going day after tomorrow.

**Kavya:** Anaya said that she will not come tomorrow.

**Tutor:** To school? Okay. So after adding 225 points, it will be 975. And why did she say that?

**Kavya:** I think she said something related to her brother only. I think she want to enjoy with him or something else, she said.

**Tutor:** You just need 25 more points... to reach?

**Kavya:** 19,000.

**Tutor:** 19,000 points. And what is Anaya's now?

**Tutor:** 18,250. The same. Because her classes...

**Kavya:** ...are not going?

**Tutor:** Yeah, for two, three days.

**Kavya:** But if she does the homework, so she will definitely get her points.

**Tutor:** She'll definitely get her points, but still, she did not do the homework. I think when her classes will start again, she will start doing them. Day after tomorrow, I think so. Let's see what happens.

**Kavya:** But she... she should do her homework.

**Tutor:** Yeah, definitely, she should be doing every day. Every day she should be doing.

**Tutor:** Hmm. Are you ready for the XP Fest?

**Kavya:** Hmm.

**Tutor:** Very good, spelling game streak of 70. You know, like, write at least this many lines. These are just five lines. At least there should be 10 to 12 lines. "My hobby is to dance." It's very nice. "I love it. When I do it, I feel free." I feel "liberated" is a better word. You know? I feel...

**Kavya:** Liberated.

**Tutor:** Liberated. Because while writing, we have to use as beautiful words as possible.

**Kavya:** What if we don't know the beautiful words?

**Tutor:** You will learn. Liberate also means free. India got its liberty in 1947, or India got liberated in 1947. So I feel liberated.

**Kavya:** Aapko pata hai quiz mein kya...

**Tutor:** Not "that." "It's." Okay? "It's so amazing. It has so many types but I do the Bollywood one." Okay? Now.

**Kavya:** Quiz mein jaise jo answer tha, main woh tick kar rahi thi toh doosra apne aap tick ho ja raha tha, woh galat ho raha tha. Phir woh teen baar hone ke baad main ekdam dhyan laga ke sahi answer mein tick ki, toh bhi woh galat tick hua aur galat bata raha tha. Us kaaran mere 13 wrong ho gaye. Main galti se wahan 27 likh di hoon. (In the quiz, when I was clicking the answer, it was automatically clicking another one, which was wrong. After it happened three times, I focused really hard and clicked the right answer, but it still clicked the wrong one and showed it was wrong. Because of that, I got 13 wrong. I accidentally wrote 27 there.)

**Tutor:** Okay. Koi baat nahi. I'll fix it. Okay? (Okay. No problem. I'll fix it. Okay?) Aisa kyun ho raha tha but? Phone mein khel rahe the? (But why was that happening? Were you playing on the phone?)

**Kavya:** Hmm.

**Tutor:** Phone mein khelne ki wajah se ho sakta hai issue hua ho. I'll check it. Main check kar lunga, theek hai? (It might have been an issue because you were playing on the phone. I'll check it. I'll check, okay?)

**Kavya:** Phone mein hi khelti hoon main quiz. (I always play the quiz on the phone.)

**Tutor:** Accha. Sirf spelling game aur math fall khelti ho laptop mein? (Oh. You only play Spelling Game and Math Fall on the laptop?)

**Kavya:** Hmm.

**Tutor:** Use bhi khel liya karo. (You should play this on it too.)

**Kavya:** Theek hai. (Okay.)

**Tutor:** Woh toh aur accha lagta hai na laptop mein bada-bada dikhta hai toh. (That one looks even better on the laptop, since it's big.)

**Tutor:** Chalo. Ab hum XP Fest start karte hain. Jaldi se. (Okay. Now let's start the XP Fest. Quickly.) Har correct answer ke... (For every correct answer...)

**Kavya:** Long answers main orally bataungi. (I'll give the long answers orally.)

**Tutor:** Kuch likhne bhi pad sakte hain. Har correct answer ke 5 points. Okay? (You might have to write some. 5 points for every correct answer. Okay?) Start kar rahe hain. Chalo, batate jaana fatafat. (We're starting. Okay, start telling me quickly.)

(Kavya gets her notebook)

**Tutor:** Aapki yeh fair copy bhi de doon science ki? (Should I give you your science fair copy too?)

**Kavya:** Science ki? Fair copy? (Science? Fair copy?)

**Tutor:** Question paper sab sambhal kar rakhe ho na? Purane term one ke question papers? (You've kept all the question papers safely, right? The old term one question papers?) Sab sambhal ke rakhna, woh kaam aayenge hamare. (Keep them all safe, they will be useful for us.)

(Kavya searches for her bag)

**Tutor:** Copy hai aapke paas likhne ke liye? (Do you have a notebook to write in?)

**Tutor:** Chalo. Write three types of carbohydrates. Write short note on three types of carbohydrates. (Okay. Write...) Aapne padhai ki na fair copy se? (You studied from your fair copy, right?)

**Kavya:** Question answer yaad nahi kiya tha. (I didn't memorize the question answers.)

**Tutor:** Toh phir kaise XP Fest doge? (Then how will you do the XP Fest?) Aur kya puchunga main? (What else will I ask?) Toh kya padhe phir? (So what did you study then?) Book ka pura. (The whole book.)

**Tutor:** Toh matlab main puchu kya aapse? (So what should I ask you then?) Questions... answers toh aayenge bhi toh wahi se. Waisa book padhe ho toh bata sakte ho. Kyunki hai toh book se hi answers sabhi. (The questions... the answers will come from there. If you've read the book, you can answer. Because all the answers are from the book.) Book mein hi toh hai na page aise 21 likha hua hai toh page 21 mein hi hai woh answer. (It's in the book, right? If it says page 21, the answer is on page 21.) Agar aap pura chapter padhe hai toh answer aap de sakte ho. (If you've read the whole chapter, you can give the answer.) The three types of... write a short note on the three types of carbohydrates.

**Kavya:** The three types of carbohydrate are monosaccharide, polysaccharide...

**Tutor:** Main... likhna hai. Sahi jaa rahe ho, sahi jaa rahe ho. (You have to... write. You're on the right track, keep going.) Likh do, likh do, likh do. Jaldi se likh do. (Write it, write it, write it. Write it quickly.) Writing matter nahi karegi, theek hai? (Writing doesn't matter, okay?) Writing gandi bhi bani toh bhi chalega. (Even if the writing is messy, it's fine.)

**Kavya:** Sugar, cellulose or... starch. Ki glucose?

**Tutor:** Starch. Jaldi likho, jaldi likho, jaldi likho. (Write quickly, quickly, quickly.) Short note na, bas naam nahi. (A short note, not just the names.) Wahan jaisa na ho jaaye, describe nuclear family. (It shouldn't be like that, describe nuclear family.) Describe matlab... ya short note bola hai matlab kya karna hai humein? (Describe means... or if it says short note, what do we have to do?)

**Kavya:** Mereko nahi pata. (I don't know.)

**Tutor:** Arre. Kaise taiyari kiye ho aap? (Oh. How did you prepare?) Nahi pata bol rahe ho matlab aap... phir toh preparation hi nahi kiye. (You're saying you don't know... that means you didn't prepare at all.)

**Tutor:** Nahi pata? Jaldi se, revise kar lo. Main aapko keval ek minute samay de raha hoon. (You don't know? Quick, revise. I'm giving you only one minute.)

(Kavya revises)

**Tutor:** Done? Easy hai ekdam. (Done? It's very easy.) Sugar is sweet. Cellulose doesn't have any taste or flavour. Starch also doesn't have any taste or flavour. Teeno mein ek cheez common hai. (This one thing is common in all three.) ...Soluble in water... Yeh bhi... (this too...)

**Tutor:** Done? Easy hai ekdam. Hmm. (Done? It's very easy. Hmm.) Ekdam kahin pe confuse hoge toh hint... ek hint aapke paas hai. Matlab ek lifeline hai. (If you get confused anywhere, a hint... you have one hint. Meaning, one lifeline.) ...aapko aise copy dikhaunga 5 second ke liye bas. (I'll show you the copy like this for just 5 seconds.)

**Tutor:** Har yeh ek question ke liye aapko 15 points milenge. Jo likh kar aap doge answer. (For this one question, you will get 15 points. The answer you give in writing.)

**Kavya:** Aur jo bol ke? (And for the ones I say orally?)

**Tutor:** Five. Speed se likhna ekdam, taaki main zyada se zyada question pooch paau, zyada se zyada XP points aap collect kar pao. (Write with speed, so I can ask more and more questions, and you can collect more and more XP points.)

(Kavya writes)

**Tutor:** Aapko pata hai aap lambe-lambe answer mere se orally likhwa ke toh zyada question pooch paoge. (You know, if you make me ask long answers orally, you'll be able to ask more questions.)

**Tutor:** Nahi nahi. Theek hai. Abhi yehi... yehi scheme follow karte hain abhi. (No, no. It's okay. Right now, this... we'll follow this scheme for now.)

(Kavya writes)

**Tutor:** Done? Main bol kar read kar raha hoon. (Done? I'm reading it aloud.) "Soluble in water and have a sweet taste. The main source of sugar is sucrose..." Theek hai. "It has no taste and they are derived from plants. Cellulose forms the main structure of plants." Likhna tha aapko yahan pe. (Okay. "It has no taste... plants." You had to write "of plants" here.) "Cellulose forms the main structure..." Bas "main structure" likh diya aapne. (You just wrote "main structure".)

**Tutor:** Aage dekho, aage dekho. (Look further, look further.) Starch. "It has no taste and soluble in water. The main source of starch is..." Ekdam sahi. (Starch... Exactly right.) 15 points mil gaye. (You get 15 points.)

**Tutor:** Teen question ho gaye. Phir se written. (Three questions are done. Written again.) Ek hi answer aaya bas teen oral mein na. Chalo do aur pooch leta hoon. (Only one correct answer in three oral questions. Okay, I'll ask two more.)
