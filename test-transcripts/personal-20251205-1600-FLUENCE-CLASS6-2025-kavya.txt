**[00:00]**

**Tutor:** Math fall? Or something else?

**Kavya:** Something else.

**Tutor:** Okay.

**Kavya:** Aaj koi sa naya game discover karein? *(Today shall we discover a new game?)*

**Tutor:** Yeah, we can do it. Do you have any idea?

**[Silence as Tutor sets up]**

**Tutor:** [Chuckles] We can definitely do it. Think. Let us try.

**Kavya:** Hmm.

**Tutor:** Chalo, if you can discover something by yourself, you will get hundred points. Hundred XP points from my side. But... like you have not been doing your homework lately. Like... your homework, no class preparation.

**Kavya:** Okay...

**Tutor:** It’s chill though. Exams... Sanskrit? Done? Like, how was it?

**Kavya:** Very nice.

**Tutor:** Did they show any... test copy?

**Kavya:** Nothing else yet. Just Science and Maths we have gotten till now.

**Tutor:** Hindi na also? Seventeen?

**Kavya:** Hmm.

**Tutor:** What about Anaya?

**Kavya:** You don’t know?

**Tutor:** Just three subjects they have shown? I think on Monday they will definitely show. English, most probably.

**Kavya:** August... Monday nahi dikhayegi ma'am. *(Ma'am won't show it on Monday.)*

**Tutor:** Why?

**Kavya:** Ma'am maybe dikhayegi... Monday bhi nahi hoyega, Tuesday bhi nahi hoyega... Wednesday ko I think hoga period. *(Ma'am maybe will show... Monday won't happen, Tuesday won't happen... I think the period is on Wednesday.)* Kyunki Monday ko first three periods... sabse pehla hota hai Science, phir Library, phir Maths. Phir Tuesday ko exam... waise bas exam nahi hoyega toh free period milega hum log ko ya toh koi si aur ma'am aayegi padhane, ya toh phir hum log dance mein jayenge. Aur do period Music hai second aur third. *(Because on Monday the first three periods... the very first is Science, then Library, then Maths. Then Tuesday is the exam... actually if the exam doesn't happen then we will get a free period or some other ma'am will come to teach, or else we will go to dance. And two periods are Music, second and third.)*

**Tutor:** Okay, okay, I have gotten an idea for a game. Immediately like I have gotten an idea. It’s new. Like I have never played it. It just came into my mind right now. It's original. So it will be very interesting. What we'll do... One by one... is it a fair copy? Like...

**Kavya:** It is a rough copy.

**Tutor:** We'll write a word...

**Kavya:** [Interrupting] Some left side pages are left... Yeah. Wait, wait. Dikhao. *(Show me.)*

**[Sound of pages turning]**

**Tutor:** No. We'll write a word in our copy. And the other person will have to guess that word in just five tries. With five questions. Like, for example, if I have written a word... Wait.

**Kavya:** Par yeh toh hum khel chuke hain na? Ten words wala hi toh hai yeh same. *(But we have played this, right? It's the same ten words one.)*

**Tutor:** Na, na, na. It's different. Like... let's make it interesting. We'll just tell the person... the person will just tell the initial and the last letter of that word to the other person. For example, I am telling you... Just wait, let us try at least. The first letter is F. The last letter is M. If you can guess the word in three tries... You can't ask me any question. You just have to guess the word in three tries. If you can...

**Kavya:** Seven...

**Tutor:** No... wrong.

**Kavya:** Ya phir ek kaam karte hain, yeh bhi bata dete hain kitne words ka hai. *(Or let's do one thing, let's also tell how many words it has.)*

**Tutor:** Aise bahut hard ho jayegi sirf teen tries mein. *(It will become very hard in just three tries like that.)* Isiliye toh mazaa aayega. *(That's why it will be fun.)*

**[05:00]**

**Tutor:** Chalo... like... we can... we can give the hint of the number of letters in the last try. In the last try only. In the third try.

**Kavya:** Fan toh nahi hai. *(It isn't Fan.)*

**Tutor:** You have just two more tries left.

**Kavya:** Feem kuch word nahi hota... Foom... *(Feem isn't a word... Foom...)*

**Tutor:** Foam.

**Kavya:** Foam.

**Tutor:** No. Not third try. Now I will be telling you the letter of the... number of letters. Seven.

**Kavya:** [Sighs] Na... It should be very easy I think.

**Tutor:** [Tapping pen] F... S... start hota hai...

**Tutor:** Have to be fast.

**Kavya:** Par aap waisa bhi word nahi likh sakte jo mere ko pata hi na ho. *(But you can't write a word that I don't even know.)*

**Tutor:** Common words hi likhenge hum. *(We will write common words only.)*

**Kavya:** Nahi yaar... samajh mein nahi aa raha. *(No man... I don't understand.)*

**Tutor:** At least try? Say any word.

**Kavya:** Seven letters ka hai na? Dekho. *(It's of seven letters right? Look.)*

**Tutor:** So you are giving up?

**Kavya:** Yeah.

**Tutor:** It was Freedom.

**Kavya:** Free... dum.

**Tutor:** Now you write down. Let me try.

**[Sound of writing]**

**Tutor:** I think this is a very interesting game.

**Kavya:** Ya apko pata hoga. *(Or maybe you know it.)*

**Tutor:** Aur aaj aap jeet gaye. *(And today you won.)*

**Kavya:** Yes. It was very hard. It was sentences. Ten sentences, not ten words. Not twenty words, ten sentences. It was. I got four right, she got three right.

**Tutor:** First letter is P... aur last letter is R. Okay.

**[Tutor thinking]**

**Tutor:** First letter is P, last letter is R. Player?

**Kavya:** Wrong.

**Tutor:** Powder?

**Kavya:** Wrong.

**Tutor:** Number of letters?

**Kavya:** Nine.

**Tutor:** Ye apka hint de di hoon... ho sakta hai ap play hard bhai... isiliye ye something movie se related hai. *(I have given you a hint... maybe you play hard brother... that's why this is something related to movies.)*

**Tutor:** Picture.

**Kavya:** [Interrupting] Na maine jaldi bol diya. *(No I said it too quickly.)* Picture toh nine word hai hi nahi. Nine letters hai hi nahi. *(Picture isn't a nine word. It doesn't have nine letters.)* Aur uske last mein E aata hai picture mein. *(And E comes at the last in picture.)*

**Tutor:** Haan. R hai bola aapne na? *(Yes. You said R right?)* Saduuuu... Sarrr mein dard hoga. *(Head... Head will ache.)* Wait, wait.

**[Tutor humming/thinking]**

**Tutor:** Protector? Protector mein toh nine... nine letters bhi hain. Aur P aur R bhi hai. But wo word nahi hai na. *(Protector has nine... nine letters too. And P and R too. But that's not the word right.)* Protector... you mean Projector hota hai. *(Protector... you mean Projector.)*

**Kavya:** Oho... Je bas karna tha. *(Just had to do J.)* Chalo. But I came very close. I came very close. Ten ten points. Do round aur bacha. *(Two rounds left.)* You know, like, I came very close. I was about to win.

**Tutor:** Bas apko Sahi bolna tha. *(You just had to say it right.)*

**Kavya:** Maine harbadi kar di na. *(I rushed it, right.)*

**Tutor:** O-R hoga spelling projector ki. O-R.

**Kavya:** Hmm.

**[10:00]**

**Tutor:** This time I'll be patient.

**Kavya:** [Laughs] Maine fatafat fatafat jo aaya bol diya. *(I just said whatever came quickly quickly.)*

**Tutor:** Chalo.

**Kavya:** Pata hai pehle main wallpaper karne wali thi. *(You know first I was going to do wallpaper.)*

**Tutor:** Achha. Done. First word is C, last word is S. Last letter is S, sorry. Not word, first letter is C, last letter is S.

**Kavya:** Jaldi karna hai? *(Have to do it quickly?)*

**Tutor:** Nahi. Ek minute baad waise bhi game end karenge, ye last round hai. Jo isme jeet gaya... wo game jeet gaya. *(No. Anyway we will end the game after one minute, this is the last round. Whoever wins this... wins the game.)*

**Kavya:** Arre padhna bhi toh hai. *(Hey we have to study also.)*

**Tutor:** Ho jayega twenty tak bas. *(It will be done by twenty.)*

**Kavya:** Nahi hoga. Aapki dance class... *(It won't happen. Your dance class...)*

**Tutor:** First three... First three aap... *(First three... First three you...)* aap... hai na? Class...

**Kavya:** Classrooms?

**Tutor:** Mmh-mmh [Negative].

**Kavya:** Last try. Seven letters.

**Tutor:** Seven letters.

**Kavya:** Aiye hint do. *(Give a hint.)*

**Tutor:** Question is the hint.

**Kavya:** Question? Seven letters na? Par ye mathematics hai aur ye ek device hai. Toh ye question toh hoga nahi. *(Seven letters right? But this is mathematics and this is a device. So this won't be a question.)*

**[Kavya thinking]**

**Kavya:** Compass ka soch rahi hoon par wo question kahan hai. *(I'm thinking of compass but where is the question.)*

**Tutor:** Compass toh Aa raha hai seven letters mein lekin wo nahi likha hai maine. *(Compass is fitting in seven letters but I haven't written that.)*

**Kavya:** Chalo last ten seconds. Par apka hint bahut ganda hai pata hai? Question. *(But your hint is very bad you know? Question.)*

**Tutor:** Questioning le lo. *(Take Questioning.)* One, two, three, four, five...

**Kavya:** Nahi pata. *(Don't know.)*

**Tutor:** Curious? Someone who is curious asks questions? Who do questioning.

**Kavya:** Okay. I won. Like last round.

**Tutor:** Theek hai. Last round, okay? If you will win this, it will be a draw. If I will win, I will be the winner.

**Kavya:** Hmm.

**Tutor:** Apke paas aaj ka pura samay bhi rahega aap ek game discover kar sakte ho kal ke liye, kal jo hum khel payenge class mein, toh apko hundred points milenge. *(You will have the whole time today also, you can discover a game for tomorrow, that we can play in class tomorrow, then you will get hundred points.)*

**Kavya:** Theek hai.

**Tutor:** You can use Google, YouTube whatever you want. But that game should be related to Mathematics. That is a condition. Like Lygridiwada or something like that. Okay?

**Kavya:** Okay. First letter is C, last letter is N. C and N.

**[Tutor thinking]**

**Tutor:** Column?

**Kavya:** [Laughs]

**Tutor:** Cocoon?

**Kavya:** Kyunki ye 12 letters hai. *(Because this is 12 letters.)*

**Tutor:** N hai...

**Kavya:** Aur hint main nahi dungi kyunki apne bhi first wale mein hint nahi diya tha. *(And I won't give a hint because you also didn't give a hint in the first one.)*

**Tutor:** Nahi nahi, hint toh dena padega. *(No no, you have to give a hint.)* Apne first wale mein nahi diya tha... Maine second wale mein diya... Apne apne second wale mein diya... Toh main mere second wale mein nahi dungi. *(You didn't give in the first one... I gave in the second one... You gave in your second one... So I won't give in my second one.)*

**Tutor:** Bina hint ke toh mushkil hai. *(Without a hint it's difficult.)*

**Kavya:** Achha chalo main apko ekdum perfect hint nahi de rahi... par bol sakte hain Brick. *(Okay come on I am not giving you a totally perfect hint... but can say Brick.)*

**Tutor:** Catches? Brick?

**Kavya:** Ek baar bol diya. *(Said it once.)*

**Tutor:** Brick? Construction?

**Kavya:** [Laughs] Pata tha. *(Knew it.)*

**[15:00]**

**Tutor:** Dono ka ten ten. *(Ten ten for both.)*

**Kavya:** Construction.

**Tutor:** Theek hai. It was a draw. *(Okay. It was a draw.)*

**Kavya:** Waisa hi hint nahi dena tha. *(Shouldn't have given a hint like that.)*

**Tutor:** Chalo. Ab wapas aate hain. *(Come on. Now let's come back.)* That's why you are getting the point. It is a draw.

**Kavya:** Nahi samajhti toh zyada mazaa aata. *(If you didn't understand it would have been more fun.)*

**Tutor:** Theek hai points kamaana kam mazaa nahi hai. *(Okay earning points isn't less fun.)*

**Kavya:** Chalo. Suno suno suno. *(Come on. Listen listen listen.)*

**Tutor:** Ab dhyan do. Ab focus karo. Pura wapas maths mein daalo. *(Now pay attention. Now focus. Put everything back into maths.)* Tab mazaa aayega. Balance hona chahiye na? *(Then it will be fun. There should be balance right?)*

**[Sound of books shuffling]**

**Tutor:** Fraction kya hota hai aapne samajh liya hai? *(Have you understood what a fraction is?)* Can you tell me what happens... fraction?

**Kavya:** Fraction?

**Tutor:** Hmm.

**Kavya:** Fraction kya tha... *(What was fraction...)* Equal part ko fraction bolte hain. *(Equal part is called fraction.)*

**Tutor:** Equal part ko fraction bolte hain? *(Equal part is called fraction?)*

**Kavya:** Nahi nahi. *(No no.)* Jis mein numerator aur denominator hota hai. *(In which there is numerator and denominator.)*

**Tutor:** Toh usse koi equal part kaise dikha rahe hain hum? *(So how are we showing any equal part with that?)*

**Kavya:** Equal hai na... matlab... matlab... *(It is equal right... I mean... I mean...)*

**Tutor:** Aur koshish karo, koshish karo pahunchoge, pahunchoge. *(Try more, try more, you will reach, you will reach.)* Dimag lagao. Aayega. *(Use your brain. It will come.)*

**[Silence as Kavya thinks]**

**Kavya:** Fraction... fraction... fraction... fraction... Jo kisi cheez ki value dikhata hai? *(That shows the value of something?)*

**Tutor:** Part of something. Very simple.

**Kavya:** Jaise is pizza ka mujhe bhi ek fraction chahiye. *(Like I also want a fraction of this pizza.)* Part chahiye, ek piece chahiye. *(Want a part, want a piece.)* Achha kitna chahiye? 1/4th chahiye. *(Okay how much do you want? Want 1/4th.)* Chaar piece hain, ek mujhe chahiye. *(There are four pieces, I want one.)* Agar ek pura chaar piece bhi nahi hai. Agar wo roti puri banti na kat ke toh pizza jaise roti banti nahi hai. *(If there isn't even a full four piece. If that roti is made whole, roti isn't made like pizza by cutting.)* Lekin apne bola mujhe 1/4th roti chahiye. *(But you said I want 1/4th roti.)* Tab humein roti ko kitne equal parts mein katna padega? *(Then into how many equal parts do we have to cut the roti?)*

**Kavya:** Four.

**Tutor:** Aur apko kitna dena padega usme se? *(And how much will we have to give you out of that?)*

**Kavya:** One.

**Tutor:** Toh apko kitna mila roti ka? *(So how much of the roti did you get?)*

**Kavya:** 1/4th.

**Tutor:** Represent kaise karenge usse? *(How will we represent that?)*

**Kavya:** One... four.

**Tutor:** Jisme one kya hai? *(In which what is one?)*

**Kavya:** Numerator.

**Tutor:** Four kya hai? *(What is four?)*

**Kavya:** Denominator.

**Tutor:** Ekdum clear explanation aaya? *(Did a totally clear explanation come?)*

**Kavya:** Theek hai.

**[20:00]**

**Tutor:** Dekho yahan par. Jaise ek roti thi. *(Look here. Like there was one roti.)* Ab ye do bande hain. Anaya aur Kavya. *(Now these are two people. Anaya and Kavya.)* Ab inko lagi hai tez bhook, kyunki log ki hai dance practice pagal jaise din bhar. *(Now they are very hungry, because these people have dance practice like crazy all day.)* Toh aur kya basketball bhi khel chuke hain. *(So and what, have played basketball also.)*

**Kavya:** Pata hai aaj subah se kuch khayi nahi thi. *(You know I hadn't eaten anything since this morning.)* Main aaj venue pe khayi hoon. *(I ate at the venue today.)*

**Tutor:** Toh samjho. Tab toh aap hi ho ye. *(So understand. Then this is you only.)* Theek hai? Ab aapko dikh gayi roti. Badhiya phuli hui paki paki si. *(Okay? Now you saw the roti. Nice and puffed up and cooked.)* Aur Anaya toh hai hi bhukkad usko bhi dikh gayi, bhale pet bhara hua hai. Usko bhi khana hai. *(And Anaya is a glutton anyway, she also saw it, even though her stomach is full. She also wants to eat.)* Ab aap dono gaye, ab aap dono kyunki friend ho toh aapne bola chalo yaar... phir bola ki mujhe bhook toh lagi hai lekin hum equal equal hi khayenge puri ek roti ka. *(Now you both went, now because you both are friends so you said come on man... then said that I am hungry but we will eat equal equal only of the whole one roti.)* Toh aapne pucha Anaya se ki are equal equal matlab kitna lenge hum roti ka. *(So you asked Anaya that hey equal equal means how much of the roti will we take.)* Toh kya jawab degi Anaya? *(So what answer will Anaya give?)*

**Kavya:** 1/4th.

**Tutor:** Char part karke. *(By doing four parts.)* Lekin wo toh boli ki hum toh do hi log hain toh char part kyun kar rahe hain? *(But she said that we are only two people so why are we doing four parts?)*

**Kavya:** Half kar lete hain, one two. *(Let's do half, one two.)*

**Tutor:** Half kar lete hain ki half hi karna padega. *(Let's do half or will have to do half only.)*

**Kavya:** Half karna padega. *(Will have to do half.)*

**Tutor:** Half matlab kya hota hai? *(What does half mean?)*

**Kavya:** One...

**Tutor:** One...

**Kavya:** One... One two.

**Tutor:** One toh whole hota hai. One two kya? Bolte kya hain usse? One two bolte hain? *(One is whole. One two what? What do we call that? Do we call it one two?)*

**Kavya:** One by two.

**Tutor:** Half bolte hain na one by two ko. *(We call one by two Half right.)*

**Kavya:** Haan.

**Tutor:** One by two ko half bolte hain. *(We call one by two half.)* Aur... nahi abhi bolte samay apko kuch toh batana padega na one upon two, one by two kuch toh bologe na? *(And... no while speaking right now you will have to tell something right one upon two, one by two you will say something right?)* Bolte samay apko wahi bolna hai one third, one fourth. *(While speaking you have to say that only one third, one fourth.)* Lekin one by three ko one third bolte hain. One by two ko kya bolte hain? *(But one by three is called one third. What is one by two called?)*

**Kavya:** Half.

**Tutor:** Toh main aapse Half puch raha hoon toh aap One Two bol rahe ho. Wo galat hai na? One by two bolo at least batate waqt. *(So I am asking you Half so you are saying One Two. That is wrong right? At least say One by Two while telling.)* Theek hai? Toh kitne roti loge dono? *(Okay? So how much roti will both take?)*

**Kavya:** One by two.

**Tutor:** One by two aur one by two. Ya toh Half Half bol do. Half matlab apko pata hona chahiye half matlab kya hota hai? *(One by two and one by two. Or say Half Half. Half means you should know what does half mean?)* 1/2.

**Kavya:** Kyun hota hai half matlab one by two? *(Why does half mean one by two?)*

**Tutor:** Kyunki agar hum dono ko divide karein... *(Because if we divide both...)*

**Kavya:** Dono ko divide karein... *(Divide both...)*

**Tutor:** Matlab Two ko divide karein... *(Meaning divide Two...)*

**Kavya:** Two ko divide karein... *(Divide Two...)* Two kya cheez ko? *(Divide Two what thing?)*

**Tutor:** Two ko divide karein one se... *(Divide Two by one...)*

**Kavya:** Two ko divide karein one se... toh one by two hi aayega. *(Divide Two by one... then one by two only will come.)*

**Tutor:** Two ko divide karein one se... matlab do chocolate ko ek jan ko baatein. *(Divide Two by one... meaning distribute two chocolates to one person.)* Aur one nahi aayega, galat bol rahe ho. *(And one won't come, you are saying it wrong.)* One by two aayega bol raha hoon. *(I am saying one by two will come.)* Nahi, two ko one se divide nahi karte hain. *(No, we don't divide two by one.)* Ek hai, usko do logo mein divide kar rahe hain. *(There is one, we are dividing it among two people.)* Isiliye ek roti, one likhe? Phir divide ka sign, phir two likhe. Ya toh isko one aur neeche upon ka sign phir two likhe. *(That's why one roti, wrote one? Then divide sign, then wrote two. Or write this one and below upon sign then two.)* Matlab ek roti kitne logo mein bat rahi hai? *(Meaning one roti is being distributed among how many people?)*

**[Silence]**

**Tutor:** Matlab ek roti kitne logo mein divide ho rahi hai? *(Meaning one roti is being divided among how many people?)*

**Kavya:** Two.

**Tutor:** Toh half matlab? *(So half means?)*

**Kavya:** One by two.

**Tutor:** One divided by two.

**Kavya:** Half ko represent karte hain one divided by two se. *(We represent half by one divided by two.)* Half matlab kya hota hai? *(What does half mean?)*

**Tutor:** Aadha aadha. *(Half half.)*

**Kavya:** Matlab example de ke batao. *(Meaning give an example and tell.)*

**Tutor:** Jaise... aath piece hain pizza ke. *(Like... there are eight pieces of pizza.)* Aur hain do... do log. *(And there are two... two people.)* Sab kuch chahiye equal equal. *(Want everything equal equal.)* Toh 4/8 pizza hoyega ek jan ko. *(So it will be 4/8 pizza to one person.)*

**Kavya:** Theek hai. *(Okay.)*

**Tutor:** Lekin half ko kaise samjhaoge aap, explain karna ho ek line mein bol kar toh? *(But how will you explain half, if you have to explain by speaking in one line then?)*

**Kavya:** Half is a... *(Half is a...)* Half meaning is... *(Half meaning is...)* The meaning of doing half is... *(The meaning of doing half is...)* Doing things in equal parts? *(Doing things in equal parts?)*

**Tutor:** Kuch missing hai. *(Something is missing.)* Jaise char equal part mein baat diya. Toh kya maine half kiya? Apke definition ke hisab se toh wahi hai. Equal part mein baat dena. Maine toh baat diya char equal part mein. Toh kya maine half kiya? *(Like distributed in four equal parts. So did I do half? According to your definition it is that only. Distribute in equal parts. I distributed in four equal parts. So did I do half?)*

**Kavya:** Doing one whole thing in equal... parts? *(Doing one whole thing in equal... parts?)* Doing one whole thing in two halves... *(Doing one whole thing in two halves...)*

**Tutor:** In two halves?

**Kavya:** In two halves?

**Tutor:** Yahan bahut close ho. Kisi bhi cheez ko do equal part mein baatna half karna hai. *(You are very close here. Distributing anything into two equal parts is doing half.)* Kabhi bhi koi cheez do equal part mein bat rahi hai toh usse half kiya ja raha hai. *(Whenever anything is being distributed into two equal parts then it is being halved.)* Apne bola mujhe half chahiye us ice cream ka. *(You said I want half of that ice cream.)* Matlab exact 50% chahiye. *(Meaning want exact 50%.)* Matlab 100% jo ice cream hai, usko do part mein baato, 50-50, mujhe 50 chahiye. *(Meaning the 100% ice cream, distribute it into two parts, 50-50, I want 50.)* Matlab 100% ice cream hai usko do part mein baato. *(Meaning there is 100% ice cream distribute it into two parts.)* Matlab ek 100% ice cream hai usko do part mein baato. *(Meaning there is one 100% ice cream distribute it into two parts.)* Matlab ek 100% ice cream hai usko do part mein baato. *(Meaning there is one 100% ice cream distribute it into two parts.)*

**[Tutor realizing he's repeating]**

**Tutor:** Matlab ek 3 number hai. Ab uska aapko half chahiye. Matlab usse do part mein baatna padega aur ek part apko dena padega. *(Meaning there is a number 3. Now you want half of it. Meaning will have to distribute it into two parts and give one part to you.)* Three ko do part mein kaise baatein? Beech se kaate. Do equal part mein three bata, kitna kitna ban gaya ab? *(How to distribute three into two parts? Cut from the middle. Three got distributed into two equal parts, how much how much did it become now?)*

**Kavya:** 1/2, 1/2.

**Tutor:** 1.5 aur 1.5. *(1.5 and 1.5.)* Jisme se aap kitna le loge? *(Out of which how much will you take?)*

**Kavya:** 1.5.

**Tutor:** Matlab half kar diya apne. Half half, toh ek half apne liya aur ek half usne liya. *(Meaning you did half. Half half, so one half you took and one half he took.)*

**Kavya:** Theek hai. *(Okay.)*

**Tutor:** Samajh aaya fraction kya hai, hota hai, half kya hota hai? *(Understood what is fraction, happens, what is half?)* Yahan par dono ko kitne kitne roti mil gaye, half half. *(Here how much roti did both get, half half.)* Half ka matlab hi, half ko represent kaise karte hain? *(The meaning of half itself, how do we represent half?)*

**Kavya:** 1/2 se. *(With 1/2.)*

**Tutor:** Ab lekin do log aur aa gaye. Shania aur Anshika. *(Now however two more people came. Shania and Anshika.)* Ab Anshika kyunki apko peeth pe maar di thi us din toh aap bole ki main toh nahi khaungi ab agar Anshika bhi aayegi roti khane toh. *(Now because Anshika hit you on the back that day so you said that I won't eat now if Anshika also comes to eat roti.)* Lekin ye teeno ne apko bola ki are kuch nahi hota, kuch nahi hota. Phir se dosti kar lo. Phir aap logo ne sabhi dosti ki acche se. Toh bola chalo kha lete hain kya hai roti hi toh hai. Pizza rahega toh nahi khaungi Anshika ke sath. Pura main kha lungi akele. Aise apne bola. *(But these three told you that hey nothing happens, nothing happens. Be friends again. Then you people all made friends nicely. So said come on let's eat what is it it's just roti. If it's pizza I won't eat with Anshika. I will eat the whole thing alone. You said like that.)* Phir ap logo ne socha ki achha ek roti ko charo mein baatna hai. Ab kaise baatein yaar? Half toh kar nahi sakte, kyunki half toh hamesha hota hai sirf do equal part mein baatna. Ab kya karein? Kitne equal part mein baatein? *(Then you people thought that okay have to distribute one roti among four. Now how to distribute man? Can't do half, because half is always distributing into just two equal parts. Now what to do? Distribute in how many equal parts?)*

**Kavya:** Char equal parts mein. *(In four equal parts.)*

**Tutor:** Toh phir wahan pe thi Kavya. Kavya ne bola are char log hain toh char equal part mein baatenge khatam baat. *(So then Kavya was there. Kavya said hey there are four people so we will distribute in four equal parts end of story.)* Phir unhone socha ki achha ek roti ko charo mein baatna hai. Ab kaise baatein? Gol roti hai usko kaise kaatein ki char equal part mein wo bat jaye? *(Then they thought okay have to distribute one roti among four. Now how to distribute? It's a round roti how to cut it so that it gets distributed in four equal parts?)* Toh sab dimag laga rahe the baith kar baith kar. Phir ek wahan pe thi Kavya. Kavya ne kya jawab diya? *(So everyone was using their brains sitting sitting. Then there was one Kavya there. What answer did Kavya give?)*

**Kavya:** Pehle ek roti ko half karenge. *(First will half one roti.)*

**Tutor:** Pehle ek roti ko half karenge. *(First will half one roti.)* Phir apne bola Anshika aur Shania ye half tum dono ka hai. Aur ye wala half mera aur Anaya ka hai. *(Then you said Anshika and Shania this half is for you both. And this half is mine and Anaya's.)* Ab Anaya aur main. *(Now Anaya and me.)*

**Kavya:** Wo jo half roti thi usko aur half karenge. *(That half roti that was there will half it more.)* Aur dono baatenge. *(And both will share.)* Aap aur Anaya. *(You and Anaya.)* Usko bhi woh dono half karenge. *(Those two will also half that.)* Aur wo dono baatenge. *(And those two will share.)*

**Tutor:** Toh har ek ko kitni roti mili? *(So how much roti did everyone get?)*

**Kavya:** One fourth, one fourth, one fourth, one fourth.

**Tutor:** Aur ye jo pura process hua usko apko number ke basis pe represent karke dikhata hoon kitna mazaa aayega dekhna. *(And this whole process that happened I will show you by representing it on the basis of numbers see how much fun it will be.)*

**[30:00]**

**[Writing sounds]**

**Tutor:** Doodoodoodoodoo...

**[Tutor humming a tune]**

**Tutor:** Do do do do...

**[Kavya joins in humming]**

**Tutor:** Dekho. *(Look.)*

**Kavya:** [Laughs] Ye kiski drawing bani hai? *(Whose drawing is this made?)*

**Tutor:** Ye hai Kavya. *(This is Kavya.)*

**Kavya:** Ye main hoon? *(This is me?)*

**Tutor:** Ye Anaya. *(This is Anaya.)*

**Kavya:** Ye Anaya? *(This is Anaya?)*

**Tutor:** Ye Shania. *(This is Shania.)*

**Kavya:** Ye Shania? *(This is Shania?)*

**Tutor:** Ye Anshika. *(This is Anshika.)*

**Kavya:** Baal toh bana do inke. *(At least make their hair.)*

**Tutor:** Baal... ye lo. *(Hair... here take it.)*

**Kavya:** Mere baal aise hain? *(My hair is like this?)*

**Tutor:** Haan toh aise hi toh hain. *(Yes so it is like this only.)*

**Kavya:** Mere baal aise hain. *(My hair is like this.)*

**Tutor:** Anaya ke baal aise. *(Anaya's hair like this.)*

**Kavya:** Anaya ke baal chhote hain. *(Anaya's hair is short.)*

**Tutor:** Shania ke baal... *(Shania's hair...)*

**Kavya:** Lambe hain. *(Are long.)*

**Tutor:** Aise. *(Like this.)*

**Kavya:** Anshika ke baal... *(Anshika's hair...)*

**Tutor:** Anshika ke baal... *(Anshika's hair...)*

**Kavya:** Chhote hain. *(Are short.)*

**Tutor:** Aise. *(Like this.)*

**Kavya:** [Laughs]

**Tutor:** Theek hai? Ab dekho. *(Okay? Now look.)* Ye thi ek roti. *(This was one roti.)* Sabse pehle apne kya kiya, isko kya kiya? *(First of all what did you do, what did you do to this?)*

**Kavya:** Half.

**Tutor:** Half. Aadha. *(Half. Half.)* Toh ye wala aadha kiske paas gaya? *(So this half went to whom?)*

**Kavya:** Anaya aur Kavya.

**Tutor:** Kavya aur Anaya ke group ke paas gaya. *(Went to Kavya and Anaya's group.)* Ye wala aadha kiske paas gaya? *(This half went to whom?)*

**Kavya:** Shania aur Anshika ke group ke paas. *(To Shania and Anshika's group.)*

**Tutor:** Shania aur Anshika ke group ke paas gaya. *(Went to Shania and Anshika's group.)* Matlab is ek roti ka aadha kiya humne. *(Meaning we did half of this one roti.)* Toh ye $\frac{1}{2}$ hai? *(So is this $\frac{1}{2}$?)*

**Kavya:** Haan. *(Yes.)*

**Tutor:** $\frac{1}{2}$ hai. *(It is $\frac{1}{2}$.)* Ab is aadhe ka bhi, is group ne kya kiya? *(Now of this half also, what did this group do?)*

**Kavya:** Aadha. *(Half.)*

**Tutor:** Aadha. *(Half.)* Matlab is aadhe ka bhi aadha kiya. *(Meaning did half of this half also.)* Of ka matlab kya hota hai maths mein? *(What is the meaning of Of in maths?)*

**Kavya:** Multiply.

**Tutor:** $\frac{1}{2}$ of $\frac{1}{2}$ kiya. *(Did $\frac{1}{2}$ of $\frac{1}{2}$.)* Toh kya aaya? *(So what came?)* One one za one. Two two za... *(One one za one. Two two za...)*

**Kavya:** Four.

**Tutor:** Toh har kisi ko kitna mila? *(So how much did everyone get?)*

**Kavya:** One fourth.

**Tutor:** Ye dekho $\frac{1}{4}$ mila hai. *(Look $\frac{1}{4}$ is received.)* Ye dekho maths mein kaise number se nikal ke aata hai wo. *(Look how it comes out from numbers in maths.)* Half of half, $\frac{1}{4}$. *(Half of half, $\frac{1}{4}$.)* Aaya? *(Came?)* Ab man lo char log aur aa gaye. *(Now suppose four more people came.)*

**Kavya:** [Groans]

**Tutor:** Inke bhi ek ek dost aa gaye. *(Their one one friend also came.)*

**Kavya:** Oh god.

**Tutor:** Kavya ka dost. Anaya ka dost. Shania ka dost. Anshika ka dost. *(Kavya's friend. Anaya's friend. Shania's friend. Anshika's friend.)* Ab kya hoga? *(Now what will happen?)*

**Kavya:** Phir se aadha aadha karenge. *(Will do half half again.)*

**Tutor:** Kiska aadha? *(Half of what?)*

**Kavya:** Us $\frac{1}{4}$ ka. *(Of that $\frac{1}{4}$.)*

**Tutor:** $\frac{1}{4}$ ka bhi half karenge. *(Will do half of $\frac{1}{4}$ also.)* Matlab $\frac{1}{2}$ of $\frac{1}{4}$. *(Meaning $\frac{1}{2}$ of $\frac{1}{4}$.)*

**Kavya:** Haan. *(Yes.)*

**Tutor:** Toh kitna aayega? *(So how much will come?)*

**Kavya:** One... one by eight.

**Tutor:** Toh har kisi ko kitna milega roti ka? *(So how much of the roti will everyone get?)*

**Kavya:** $\frac{1}{8}$.

**Tutor:** Samajh aa raha hai maths kaise kaam karta hai fraction mein? *(Understanding how maths works in fraction?)* $\frac{1}{2}$ of $\frac{1}{2}$ of $\frac{1}{2}$. *( $\frac{1}{2}$ of $\frac{1}{2}$ of $\frac{1}{2}$.)*

**Kavya:** $\frac{1}{2}$ into $\frac{1}{2}$ into $\frac{1}{2}$.

**Tutor:** Is equal to $\frac{1}{8}$. *(Is equal to $\frac{1}{8}$.)* Kyunki $2 \times 2 = 4$. $4 \times 2 = 8$. *(Because $2 \times 2 = 4$. $4 \times 2 = 8$.)*

**Kavya:** One eighth.

**Tutor:** One eighth. One eighth. One eighth. One eighth. Aaya samajh? *(Came understanding?)*

**Kavya:** Aaya. *(Came.)*

**Tutor:** Maza aaya? *(Did fun come?)*

**Kavya:** Aaya. *(Came.)*

**[35:00]**

**Tutor:** Ab ye batao. *(Now tell this.)* Kisko zyada roti milegi? *(Who will get more roti?)* Jab char log the tab zyada roti mil rahi thi? Ki jab aath log the tab zyada roti mil rahi thi? *(When there were four people then were getting more roti? Or when there were eight people then were getting more roti?)*

**Kavya:** Char log the. *(Four people were there.)*

**Tutor:** Jab char log the tab kitna mil raha tha har kisi ko? *(When there were four people then how much was everyone getting?)*

**Kavya:** One fourth.

**Tutor:** Aur jab aath log the tab kitna mil raha tha har kisi ko? *(And when there were eight people then how much was everyone getting?)*

**Kavya:** One eighth.

**Tutor:** Toh kaun sa bada hai $\frac{1}{4}$ ki $\frac{1}{8}$? *(So which one is bigger $\frac{1}{4}$ or $\frac{1}{8}$?)*

**Kavya:** $\frac{1}{4}$.

**Tutor:** Lekin wahan toh 8 likha hai neeche. *(But there 8 is written below.)*

**Kavya:** Toh kya hua? *(So what?)*

**Tutor:** 8 toh bada hota hai 4 se. *(8 is bigger than 4.)*

**Kavya:** 8 bada hota hai par... *(8 is big but...)* Par... parts toh chote ho gaye na. *(But... the parts became small right.)*

**Tutor:** Yes! Parts toh chote ho gaye na. *(Yes! Parts became small right.)*

**Kavya:** Toh $\frac{1}{4}$ bada hai. *(So $\frac{1}{4}$ is big.)*

**Tutor:** $\frac{1}{4}$ bada hai. *( $\frac{1}{4}$ is big.)* Toh agar numerator same hai, one or one. *(So if numerator is same, one or one.)* Toh denominator jitna chota hoga, number utna bada hoga. *(Then the smaller the denominator, the bigger the number will be.)*

**Kavya:** Hmm.

**Tutor:** $\frac{1}{2}$ bada hai ki $\frac{1}{4}$? *(Is $\frac{1}{2}$ big or $\frac{1}{4}$?)*

**Kavya:** $\frac{1}{2}$.

**Tutor:** Kyunki $\frac{1}{2}$ mein toh sirf do part mein divide hua tha. *(Because in $\frac{1}{2}$ it was divided in only two parts.)* Toh humko aadha mil gaya tha pura. *(So we got half fully.)* $\frac{1}{4}$ mein toh us aadhe ka bhi aadha ho gaya. *(In $\frac{1}{4}$ even that half became half.)* Aur chota ho gaya. *(Became even smaller.)* $\frac{1}{8}$ mein toh us aadhe ke aadhe ka aadha ho gaya. *(In $\frac{1}{8}$ that half of half became half.)* Aur chota ho gaya. *(Became even smaller.)* Toh jitna bada denominator, agar numerator same hai, toh utna chota value. *(So the bigger the denominator, if numerator is same, then the smaller the value.)*

**Kavya:** Hmm.

**Tutor:** $\frac{1}{9}$ bada hai ki $\frac{1}{5}$? *(Is $\frac{1}{9}$ big or $\frac{1}{5}$?)*

**Kavya:** One by... *(One by...)*

**Tutor:** $\frac{1}{9}$ bada hai ki $\frac{1}{5}$ bada hai? *(Is $\frac{1}{9}$ big or $\frac{1}{5}$ big?)*

**Kavya:** One by... five?

**Tutor:** Soch ke bolo. *(Think and speak.)* Tukka nahi marna hai. *(Don't have to guess.)* Imagine kar lo roti ko. *(Imagine the roti.)* Ek roti ko nau logo mein baatna hai. Aur ek roti ko paanch logo mein baatna hai. Kisme zyada milega? *(Have to distribute one roti among nine people. And have to distribute one roti among five people. In which will get more?)*

**Kavya:** Five.

**Tutor:** Toh $\frac{1}{5}$ bada hua. *(So $\frac{1}{5}$ became big.)* Kyunki usme kam logo mein bat raha hai. *(Because in that it is being distributed among fewer people.)* Toh sabko bada bada hissa milega. *(So everyone will get big big share.)* Ab nau logo mein bat raha hai, toh sabko chota chota hissa milega. *(Now it is being distributed among nine people, so everyone will get small small share.)*

**Tutor:** $\frac{1}{12}$ bada hai ki $\frac{1}{13}$? *(Is $\frac{1}{12}$ big or $\frac{1}{13}$?)*

**Kavya:** One by... One by twelve.

**Tutor:** $\frac{1}{100}$ bada hai ki $\frac{1}{200}$? *(Is $\frac{1}{100}$ big or $\frac{1}{200}$?)*

**Kavya:** $\frac{1}{100}$.

**Tutor:** $\frac{1}{300}$ bada hai ki $\frac{1}{30}$? *(Is $\frac{1}{300}$ big or $\frac{1}{30}$?)*

**Kavya:** $\frac{1}{30}$.

**Tutor:** $\frac{1}{5}$ bada hai ki $\frac{1}{2}$? *(Is $\frac{1}{5}$ big or $\frac{1}{2}$?)*

**Kavya:** $\frac{1}{2}$.

**Tutor:** $\frac{1}{2}$ bada hai ki $\frac{1}{3}$? *(Is $\frac{1}{2}$ big or $\frac{1}{3}$?)*

**Kavya:** $\frac{1}{2}$.

**Tutor:** Pakka? *(Sure?)*

**Kavya:** Haan. *(Yes.)*

**Tutor:** Lock kar diya jaye? *(Should it be locked?)*

**Kavya:** Haan. *(Yes.)*

**Tutor:** One crore points ke liye? *(For one crore points?)*

**Kavya:** Haan. *(Yes.)*

**Tutor:** Jeet gaye aap. *(You won.)*

**Kavya:** [Laughs]

**[40:00]**

**Tutor:** Easy tha? *(Was it easy?)*

**Kavya:** Hmm.

**Tutor:** Concept samajh mein aa gaya fraction ka? *(Understood the concept of fraction?)* Ki fraction ka matlab hissa. *(That fraction means share.)* Part.

**Kavya:** Hmm.

**Tutor:** Ab fraction ko maths mein likhte kaise hain? *(Now how do we write fraction in maths?)* One divided by... something. *(One divided by... something.)* One upon something. *(One upon something.)* Jaise $\frac{1}{2}$. Iska matlab hai ki ek cheez ko do logo mein baata gaya. *(Like $\frac{1}{2}$. This means one thing was distributed among two people.)* $\frac{1}{4}$. Ek cheez ko char logo mein baata gaya. *( $\frac{1}{4}$. One thing was distributed among four people.)* $\frac{1}{8}$. Ek cheez ko aath logo mein baata gaya. *( $\frac{1}{8}$. One thing was distributed among eight people.)*

**Tutor:** $\frac{3}{4}$ ka matlab kya hoga? *(What will $\frac{3}{4}$ mean?)*

**Kavya:** Teen cheez ko char logo mein baata gaya? *(Three things distributed among four people?)*

**Tutor:** Very good. Teen cheez ko char logo mein baata gaya. *(Very good. Three things distributed among four people.)* Three divided by four. *(Three divided by four.)* Jaise teen roti hai. Aur char log hain khane wale. *(Like there are three rotis. And four people to eat.)* Toh har ek ko kitni roti milegi? *(So how much roti will each get?)* $\frac{3}{4}$ roti milegi. *(Will get $\frac{3}{4}$ roti.)*

**Kavya:** Hmm.

**Tutor:** Ye prove kar sakte ho aap? *(Can you prove this?)*

**Kavya:** Prove?

**Tutor:** Ki teen roti hai... char log hain... toh har ek ko $\frac{3}{4}$ roti milegi. *(That there are three rotis... four people... so everyone will get $\frac{3}{4}$ roti.)* Ye prove kaise karenge? *(How will we prove this?)*

**Kavya:** Maths se. *(By maths.)*

**Tutor:** Maths se hi karna hai. *(Have to do by maths only.)*

**Kavya:** Divide karke? *(By dividing?)*

**Tutor:** Divide karke hi. *(By dividing only.)* Dekho, simple si baat hai. *(Look, it's a simple thing.)* Total roti ka weight man lo 1 kg hai. *(Assume total roti weight is 1 kg.)* Teen roti milakar 1 kg ki hai. *(Three rotis combined are of 1 kg.)*

**Kavya:** Okay.

**Tutor:** Toh har ek roti kitne ki hui? *(So how much is each roti?)*

**Kavya:** 1 divided by 3?

**Tutor:** $1000g$ divided by $3$. $333.33g$. *( $1000g$ divided by $3$. $333.33g$.)*

**Kavya:** Hmm.

**Tutor:** Ab char log khane wale hain. *(Now four people are there to eat.)* Total weight kitna hai roti ka? *(What is the total weight of roti?)*

**Kavya:** 1 kg.

**Tutor:** Char logo mein baatna hai. *(Have to distribute among four people.)* Toh 1 kg divided by 4. *(So 1 kg divided by 4.)* Kitna milega har ek ko? *(How much will each get?)*

**Kavya:** 1 divided by 4... 250 grams.

**Tutor:** 250 grams. Matlab $\frac{1}{4}$ kg mila har kisi ko. *(250 grams. Meaning everyone got $\frac{1}{4}$ kg.)*

**Kavya:** Hmm.

**Tutor:** Ab ye batao... agar teen roti hai. *(Now tell this... if there are three rotis.)*

**[Tutor pauses, restructuring the thought]**

**Tutor:** Teen roti hai. Char log hain. *(Three rotis. Four people.)*

**Kavya:** Toh har kisi ko... *(So everyone...)*

**Tutor:** Har kisi ko milega $\frac{3}{4}$. *(Everyone will get $\frac{3}{4}$.)*

**Kavya:** Hmm.

**Tutor:** Isko aise samjho. *(Understand it like this.)* Ek glass juice hai. *(There is one glass of juice.)* Char log hain peene wale. *(Four people to drink.)* Kitna milega har kisi ko? *(How much will everyone get?)*

**Kavya:** $\frac{1}{4}$.

**Tutor:** Ab teen glass juice hai. *(Now there are three glasses of juice.)* Char log hain peene wale. *(Four people to drink.)* Kitna milega har kisi ko? *(How much will everyone get?)*

**Kavya:** Char log hain peene wale? *(Four people to drink?)*

**Tutor:** Teen glass juice hai. *(Three glasses of juice.)* Char log hain peene wale. *(Four people to drink.)*

**Kavya:** Ek glass kisi aur ko de denge. *(Will give one glass to someone else.)*

**Tutor:** Nahi! *(No!)*

**Kavya:** [Laughs]

**Tutor:** Maths lagana hai, daan nahi karna hai. *(Have to apply maths, don't have to donate.)*

**Kavya:** Teen glass juice hai... *(Three glasses of juice...)* Char log hain... *(Four people...)*

**Tutor:** $\frac{3}{4}$.

**Kavya:** $\frac{3}{4}$?

**Tutor:** Haan. 3 divided by 4. *(Yes. 3 divided by 4.)*

**Kavya:** 3 divided by 4.

**Tutor:** Simple. Jitna samaan hai, divided by jitne log hain. *(Simple. How much stuff there is, divided by how many people are there.)*

**Kavya:** Jitna samaan hai... divided by jitne log hain. *(How much stuff there is... divided by how many people are there.)*

**Tutor:** Wahi toh fraction hai. *(That is fraction.)* Total samaan upon total log. *(Total stuff upon total people.)*

**Kavya:** Hmm.

**[45:00]**

**Tutor:** Agar 10 chocolate hai. *(If there are 10 chocolates.)* 5 log hain. *(5 people are there.)* Kitna milega har kisi ko? *(How much will each get?)*

**Kavya:** 10... 10 by 5.

**Tutor:** 10 by 5. Solve karo 10 by 5 ko. *(10 by 5. Solve 10 by 5.)* 10 divided by 5.

**Kavya:** Two.

**Tutor:** Toh har kisi ko 2 chocolate milegi. *(So everyone will get 2 chocolates.)* Sahi hai? *(Is it right?)*

**Kavya:** Sahi hai. *(It is right.)*

**Tutor:** 10 chocolate 5 logo mein baatenge toh 2-2 milegi na? *(If we distribute 10 chocolates among 5 people then will get 2-2 right?)*

**Kavya:** Haan. *(Yes.)*

**Tutor:** Wahi toh kiya humne fraction mein. *(That is what we did in fraction.)* 10 upon 5. $\frac{10}{5}$.

**Kavya:** $\frac{10}{5}$.

**Tutor:** 10 samaan tha. 5 log the. *(10 stuff was there. 5 people were there.)* 3 samaan tha. 4 log the. *(3 stuff was there. 4 people were there.)* Toh $\frac{3}{4}$ milega. *(So will get $\frac{3}{4}$.)*

**Kavya:** Hmm.

**Tutor:** 1 samaan tha. 4 log the. *(1 stuff was there. 4 people were there.)* Toh $\frac{1}{4}$ milega. *(So will get $\frac{1}{4}$.)*

**Kavya:** Hmm.

**Tutor:** 1 samaan tha. 2 log the. *(1 stuff was there. 2 people were there.)* Toh $\frac{1}{2}$ milega. *(So will get $\frac{1}{2}$.)*

**Kavya:** Hmm.

**Tutor:** Aaya samajh? *(Understood?)*

**Kavya:** Aaya. *(Came.)*

**Tutor:** Pakka? *(Sure?)*

**Kavya:** Pakka. *(Sure.)*

**Tutor:** Maza aaya? *(Did fun come?)*

**Kavya:** Aaya. *(Came.)*

**Tutor:** $\frac{3}{4}$ ki value nikalni ho toh? *(If we have to find the value of $\frac{3}{4}$ then?)*

**Kavya:** Value?

**Tutor:** Jaise $\frac{10}{5}$ ki value 2 aayi. *(Like value of $\frac{10}{5}$ came 2.)* $\frac{3}{4}$ ki value kya aayegi? *(What will be the value of $\frac{3}{4}$?)*

**Kavya:** Point mein aayegi. *(Will come in point.)*

**Tutor:** Point mein aayegi. *(Will come in point.)* 3 ko 4 se divide karenge. *(Will divide 3 by 4.)*

**Kavya:** Hmm.

**Tutor:** 0.75 aayega. *(0.75 will come.)*

**Kavya:** Hmm.

**Tutor:** Matlab agar ek glass mein 1 litre juice tha. *(Meaning if in one glass there was 1 litre juice.)* 1000 ml juice tha. *(1000 ml juice was there.)* Toh 0.75 litre milega. *(So 0.75 litre will be received.)* Matlab 750 ml milega har kisi ko. *(Meaning 750 ml will be received by everyone.)*

**Kavya:** Hmm.

**Tutor:** Ye hota hai calculation. *(This is calculation.)*

**Kavya:** Hmm.

**Tutor:** Theek hai? *(Okay?)*

**Kavya:** Theek hai. *(Okay.)*

**Tutor:** Chalo. Aaj ke liye itna hi rakhte hain. *(Come on. Let's keep it this much for today.)*

**Kavya:** Bye.

**Tutor:** Bye bye.
