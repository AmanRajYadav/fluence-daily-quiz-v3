Maths Class: Perimeter and Area

Participants:

Aman Sir (Teacher)

Kavya (Student)

Kavya: I was talking to my only.

Aman Sir: Okay. Ah can you turn off the AC please?

Kavya: Sure.

Aman Sir: Okay. What were you talking about?

Kavya: Nothing, just about Diwali and she was taking my help to choose her clothes.

Aman Sir: Okay. You're talking to her right now?

Kavya: Yeah, yeah.

Aman Sir: Okay. I have done all the homework.

Kavya: Amazing. You know?

Aman Sir: All? Really?

Kavya: All. Sir bas mereko maths mein ye do questions mein mereko problem aa rahi thi, hum woh nahi kiye. (Sir, just in maths, I was having a problem with these two questions, so I didn't do those.)

Aman Sir: Hmm.

Kavya: Jyada nahi hai. (It's not a lot.) Ye dono nahi ban raha tha. (I couldn't solve these two.)

Aman Sir: Hmm.

Kavya: Aur isme se four, five, aur ek ye seven tha. (And from this, it was four, five, and this one, seven.)

Aman Sir: Okay. So, about reading a chapter?

Kavya: Ocean and Continents.

Aman Sir: You read. Well done. Social Science. I think we had studied that chapter only.

Kavya: Only question answers we have done.

Aman Sir: Okay. Nice. Still, we have completed one-one chapter from the main subjects. That's nice. And what else? Quiz summary was not there? Was it there? Okay. I think for last Saturday, it was there. And apart from that, was there any other homework?

Kavya: Mathallen, spelling game I have played. Then I have done the geogactivity and I have also done the bonus activity. Then, you said that you will take one challenge of me and Anaya after the class.

Aman Sir: Quiz challenge. Yeah, I think I was saying. Yeah. We'll definitely do it.

Kavya: When?

Aman Sir: Monday, done.

Kavya: Sure?

Aman Sir: Sure. During Anaya's class. So you have to take your lunch early and be ready. Her class starts at 2:30. Okay? With your laptop, you have to be ready.

Kavya: Okay.

Aman Sir: And...

Kavya: Because... Usme kya aayega? (What will be in it?)

Aman Sir: Isme means? (In this means?)

Kavya: Matlab uss challenge mein kya aayega? (I mean, what will be in that challenge?)

Aman Sir: Quiz about what did I... what had I said?

Kavya: About science.

Aman Sir: Yeah, then we'll do that only. I will tell her ahead that please be prepared, we'll do science quiz of chapter two and also Maths, chapter six on Monday. With you and Kavya, I'll just tell her for 10 minutes. And because you have done all of your homework, even with so many festivals around, I am so happy. Like, and even your confidence is so high that you are... like, you are able to tell me like which are the places where you have doubts and all. So, like, instead of 300 points, I will give you 500 points. Total, today. Yeah. I'm really happy that you are very consistent with your homework. Almost every day you are doing your homework and even with this festivals, you have done it. I'm amazed. Very good. Let us first just clear the doubts of Maths, then we'll move on to some other subject, okay?

Kavya: 1800-250 tha na? (It was 1800-250, right?)

Aman Sir: Okay, sorry. It will become 750. Thank you. Anaya ka kitna hai? (How much does Anaya have?)

Kavya: 18... 255. Main agar 50 mein hoti toh woh mere se paanch point aage thi bas. (If I were at 50, she would have been just five points ahead of me.) Hmm.

Aman Sir: Anaya keh rahi thi ab main poora homework... (Anaya was saying that now I'll do all the homework...)

Kavya: Just one. She is not consistent. She told that some guests are there at her house.

Aman Sir: Hmm.

Kavya: Yesterday, we have gone to meet everyone...

Aman Sir: We had.

Kavya: We had gone to meet everyone on Chhapa. So, at night, one family, means they are very close to my father, they were going to watch a movie. So my father told, "You go, you watch movie and stay there only at night, okay?" Then we came at 12 o'clock something. Then we have gone to sleep at 2 o'clock. Then we have again watched another movie till 4 o'clock in the morning.

Aman Sir: Which movie?

Kavya: Darlings.

Aman Sir: And before that?

Kavya: And before that, Thamaa.

Aman Sir: Okay. Thamaa in theatre?

Kavya: Yeah. It was very good.

Aman Sir: At 4 o'clock at home? Or in theatre only?

Kavya: On theatre till 12 o'clock. Then at home...

Aman Sir: On Netflix?

Kavya: On Netflix, Darlings. Of Alia Bhatt, I think?

Aman Sir: Yeah.

Kavya: And we lied to everyone that hum log 2:30 baje so gaye the. (we went to sleep at 2:30.)

Aman Sir: We lied to everyone. Yeah. Nice. So you had your fun. Well done. Give me a pen.

Kavya: Aaj sirf pencil bhi hai. (Today I only have a pencil.)

Aman Sir: You just have pencil today?

Kavya: No, no, pen also.

Aman Sir: Nice. Pencil is also good. Now, focus. Let it be. Just this one?

Kavya: These both.

Aman Sir: Let us first solve this.

Kavya: Isme na pattern find karna hai. Dekho, 132 kiye toh 26 aaya toh 152 karenge toh 30 aayega iska answer. (We have to find the pattern in this. See, when we did 132, we got 26, so if we do 152, the answer will be 30.)

Aman Sir: No, no. Aisa pattern find nahi karna hai, woh pattern abhi ban ja raha hai, but ye galti mat karna isse problem ho sakta hai. (You don't have to find a pattern like that. That pattern is forming now, but don't make this mistake, it can cause a problem.)

Kavya: Toh meri ma'am ne toh humko aise hi karwayi hai. (But my ma'am taught it to me this way.)

Aman Sir: No.

Kavya: Sab mein aise hi karwayi hai. Dekho. (She has taught all of them this way. Look.) Haan. Iska bhi pattern find karwayi hai, iska bhi pattern, iska bhi pattern find karwayi hai, iska bhi pattern find karwayi hai. (She made us find the pattern for this, for this, for this, and for this too.)

Aman Sir: Hmm, woh sahi tarika nahi hai. (Hmm, that's not the right way.)

Kavya: Aapko garmi nahi lag rahi? (Aren't you feeling hot?)

Aman Sir: No, because I am sick. Thandi lag rahi hai ulta. (On the contrary, I'm feeling cold.) Chalo dekho yahan par aapko pattern-vattern find nahi karna hai. Pattern chapter ka use aap mat karo yahan pe, usse problem jyada hogi help se. Better hai dimaag lagao. Hai na? Kya dimaag lagao? Ye hai 13 square cm. Kya hai iska ye? Is shape ka? 13 square cm area hai. Ab aapko pata hai ye shape kya hai ek? (Okay, look here, you don't have to find any patterns. Don't use the 'pattern' chapter here, it will create more problems than help. It's better to use your brain. Right? What brain should you use? This is 13 square cm. What is this? Of this shape? The area is 13 square cm. Now you know what shape this is?)

Kavya: Rectangle.

Aman Sir: Aur rectangle ka area kaise nikalta hai? (And how is the area of a rectangle calculated?)

Kavya: Length into breadth.

Aman Sir: Toh wahi aapko dimaag lagana hai ki kya iska length aur kya breadth hoga? Aise kya numbers iske length aur breadth hon jisse iska area 13 square cm aaye? Toh humne dimaag lagaya. 13 toh kisi ko... do number ko multiply karke aane hi nahi wala. 13 aur 1 ke alawa. Toh pakka 13 aur 1 hi iske length aur breadth hain. Ab 1 ye wala side humne kyun liya? Kyunki ye chota hai is side se. Isliye humne ise 1 cm liya aur ise 13 cm liya. Ab jaise humko ye wala side mil gaya 13. Toh humne phir dimaag lagaya. Accha is poore shape ka area 26 square cm hai. Jiska breadth 13 aa gaya hai. Hai na? Toh ab iska length kitna hoga? Toh humne dimaag lagaya. 13 se kya multiply kare ki 26 square cm aayega? Toh humne two likh diya. Ab jaise yahan par two aa gaya, aur ye... ye kehna chahiye 15 square cm tha. Hai na? Idhar ek cheez 1 aa chuki hai. Toh 1 se kya multiply kare ki 15 square... 15? Toh idhar 15 mila humko. Ab phir humne dimaag lagana shuru kiya ki 152 karenge toh area kya aayega? (So that's what you have to think about, what will be its length and breadth? What numbers could be its length and breadth so that its area is 13 square cm? So we thought about it. 13 won't come by multiplying any two numbers. Except for 13 and 1. So for sure, 13 and 1 are its length and breadth. Now why did we take this side as 1? Because it's smaller than this side. That's why we took it as 1 cm and this as 13 cm. Now as we got this side as 13. Then we thought again. Okay, the area of this entire shape is 26 square cm. Its breadth is 13. Right? So what will be its length now? So we thought. What should we multiply by 13 to get 26 square cm? So we wrote two. Now as two came here, and this... I should say this was 15 square cm. Right? One thing here is already 1. So what should we multiply by 1 to get 15 square... 15? So we got 15 here. Then we started thinking that if we do 152, what will be the area?)

Kavya: 30.

Aman Sir: 30 square cm. Aise nikalna hai. Jo aap bol rahe ho usse bhool jao. Woh problem hogi. Theek hai? (This is how you have to solve it. Forget what you are saying. That will cause a problem. Okay?) Ye ban gaya vaise hi dimaag laga-laga kar. Hai na? Ispe sochte hain chalo. Iska humse isne kya pucha hai? (This was solved similarly by thinking it through. Right? Let's think about this one. What has it asked us about this?)

Kavya: Batao iska kaise hua? Kyunki ye square hai. Hai na? (Tell me how this happened? Because this is a square. Right?)

Aman Sir: Kaise pata woh square hai? (How do you know it's a square?)

Kavya: Uska shape dekh ke. (By looking at its shape.)

Aman Sir: Phir bhi, aise nahi keh sakte. Kya pata 1 point ka antar ho. Shape dekh kar maths... dekh kar bas kuch nahi kaha ja sakta. Hai na? Toh ye humne dimaag se nikala tha uss... yaad karo? Yaad karo, yaad karo. Yaad aaya? Kare abhi? Banaye dekho use. Dimaag bas lagana hai isme pata hai? Jaise iska aapko ek side pata hai 3. Aur ye bhi 3 hua. Hai na? Ye wali side pata kar leni hai. Ab is wali side ko pata kaise kare? Toh ye 10 square cm tha. Theek hai? Ye bhi 10 square cm tha. Isme pehle se hi 2 cm hai. Hai na? Ye chota area pata nahi. Toh 3 ke saath kya plus karein phir jisse 2 se multiply karein toh 10 aayega? (Still, you can't say that. What if there's a difference of 1 point. In maths, by looking at the shape... you can't say anything just by looking. Right? So we figured this out with our brain... remember? Remember, remember. Remembered? Should we do it now? Look, let's make it. You just have to use your brain in this, you know? Like, you know one side of this is 3. And this also became 3. Right? We need to find this side. Now how to find this side? So this was 10 square cm. Okay? This was also 10 square cm. This already has 2 cm in it. Right? We don't know this small area. So what should we add to 3, and then multiply by 2, to get 10?)

Kavya: 5.

Aman Sir: Haan, 3 ke saath 2 plus karein phir woh 5 ban jayega, 2 se multiply karke 10 cm aayega. Toh ye humein 5 mil gaya? Ab ye jaise 5 mila, toh 5 ke saath is side kya hona chahiye? Nahi ye 2 mila, 2 mila sorry. Hai na? Toh 2 ke saath idhar kya multiply ho ki 10 aaye? (Yes, if we add 2 to 3, it will become 5, and multiplying by 2 will give 10 cm. So we got this as 5? Now as we got this as 5, what should be on this side with 5? No, we got 2, 2 sorry. Right? So what should be multiplied with 2 here to get 10?)

Kavya: 5.

Aman Sir: 5. Toh jab ye poora 5 hai, aur itna 2 hai, toh ye kya hoga? Ye poora 5 hai. (5. So when this whole thing is 5, and this much is 2, then what will this be? This whole thing is 5.)

Kavya: 3.

Aman Sir: Haan 3 ho gaya aise dimaag lagaya na humne. Tab woh 33 hoke yahan pe 9 aaya. Jaise main aapse ye puchta hoon. Ye dono line kya hain? Equal hain. Haan ya na? Ye poori line ka length hai 10 cm. Theek hai? Aur ye line mein yahan tak hai 4 cm. Yahan tak. Toh ye distance kya hoga batao? (Yes, it became 3, that's how we used our brain. Then it became 33 and we got 9 here. Like if I ask you this. What are these two lines? They are equal. Yes or no? The length of this entire line is 10 cm. Okay? And in this line, it's 4 cm up to here. Up to here. So tell me what this distance will be?)

Kavya: 6 cm.

Aman Sir: Bas. Itna logic lagana humein aana chahiye. Ab ispe dimaag lagate hain. Ye iska area nikalna hai, hai na humein? Ye poora 15 hai. Theek hai? Ye 3, 6, ye 5. Ab ise banate hain chalo ek-ek karke. Aap bhi bata sakte ho kya karein, aise aapko aa raha ho toh ye karein, ye karein? Aapke dimaag mein kuch aa raha hai pehle ye kar sakte hain aisa? Humein ye dimension aur ye dimension find karni hai pata chal gaya na? Ye dimension abhi toh samajh nahi aa rahi kaise niklega. Aa rahi kya aapko? Ye wali mujhe dikh raha hai thoda sa. Aapko dikh raha hai kya? Ye wali nikali ja sakti hai. Kaise? (That's it. We should know how to apply this much logic. Now let's think about this. We need to find its area, right? This whole thing is 15. Okay? This 3, 6, this 5. Now let's make it, let's do it one by one. You can also tell me what to do, if you know, should we do this, do that? Is anything coming to your mind that we can do this first? We need to find this dimension and this dimension, we got it, right? I can't understand how to find this dimension right now. Do you? I can see this one a little bit. Can you see it? This one can be found. How?) Is rectangle ko dekho. 6 hai. 42 area kaise aaya hoga? (Look at this rectangle. It's 6. How did the area become 42?) Pado table 6 ka. (Read the table of 6.) Bolkar. (Aloud.) 42 6 ke table mein aata hai? (Does 42 come in the table of 6?)

Kavya: Seven.

Aman Sir: Kitne baar mein? (How many times?)

Kavya: Seven.

Aman Sir: Toh? (So?)

Kavya: Toh agar ye 3 hai toh phir ye 4 aayega. (So if this is 3 then this will be 4.) Hmm.

Aman Sir: Sure na? (Are you sure?)

Kavya: Haan. (Yes.)

Aman Sir: Pakka? (For sure?)

Kavya: Pakka. (For sure.)

Aman Sir: Bas. Ek dimension aa gaya? Ab ye poora 7 hai, toh ye bhi poora 7 aayega. Aur utna 5 hai. 7+5=12. (That's it. Got one dimension? Now this whole thing is 7, so this will also be 7. And that much is 5. 7+5=12.) 13, 14, 15. Haan 12. Toh 12 ke table mein 60 kitne za aata hai? (Yes 12. So how many times does 60 come in the table of 12?)

Kavya: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60. 5 za. (12, 24, 36, 48, 60. 5 times.)

Aman Sir: Toh iska 5 hua. Aur iska 6 hua. 5+6=11. Toh iska 4 idhar aayega. Woh toh maine tukke se bol diya tha pata hai uss time. 5 hi nikal gaya. Ab area nikal sakte hain? Area of main hai iska. (So this is 5. And this is 6. 5+6=11. So its 4 will come here. I had said that by fluke at that time, you know. It turned out to be 5. Now can we find the area? The main thing is its area.)

Kavya: 16.

Aman Sir: 16 square cm. Easy hai? (16 square cm. Is it easy?)

Kavya: Haan. (Yes.)

Aman Sir: Chalo isko... aapne hi banaya, maine nahi banaya hai. Aap hi banaogi ise bhi. (Okay this... you made it, I didn't. You will make this one too.) Kahan, kiska find karna hai? (Where, whose do we have to find?)

Kavya: Ye length find karni hai is rectangle ki, ye wali length find karni hai. (We have to find this length of this rectangle, this length has to be found.)

Aman Sir: Haan. (Yes.)

Kavya: Ye toh sabse easy hai. Itna 4 hai, itna 5 hai. (This is the easiest. This much is 4, this much is 5.) Humko ye chahiye na dekha jaye toh? (We need this, right, if you see?)

Aman Sir: Haan. (Yes.)

Kavya: Haan ye chahiye. Toh 5 mein kitna karenge toh 18 aayega? 5 mein karne se 18 aayega hi nahi. (Yes, we need this. So what will we do in 5 to get 18? We won't get 18 by doing it in 5.)

Aman Sir: Haan dikhao dikhao dikhao. (Yes show me, show me, show me.)

Kavya: Ye galat aayega question. (This question will be wrong.)

Aman Sir: Ye hai 5 cm aur area 18 square cm. Wow! (This is 5 cm and the area is 18 square cm. Wow!)

Kavya: Point mein aayega kuch. (It will be something in points.)

Aman Sir: Haan. Matlab dekho, dekho. Maan lo isko 'x' maan le kya abhi pata nahi toh humein? Maths mein guessing nahi chalti. Ise abhi 'x' maan le hum? Kyunki kuch nahi pata toh hum kya maan rahe hain? 'x'. Jaise bolte hai na blah blah blah. x y z. Woh kaun hai, main nahi jaanti woh koi x y z hai, mujhe usse nahi milna for example. Toh hum bhi ye koi 'x' hai. Aise maan lete hain. Aur kya-kya ko multiply karenge toh 18 aana chahiye? Yahan par dekho na. Idhar kya hai? (Yes. I mean, look, look. Let's assume this as 'x' for now since we don't know? Guessing doesn't work in maths. Let's assume this as 'x' for now? Because we don't know anything, so what are we assuming? 'x'. Like they say, blah blah blah. x y z. Who is that, I don't know, it's some x y z, I don't want to meet them, for example. So we too, this is some 'x'. Let's assume it like that. And what-what will we multiply to get 18? Look here. What is here?)

Kavya: 5.

Aman Sir: Kya se multiply hoga? (What will it be multiplied by?)

Kavya: Likha toh hai. (It is written.) 'x' se. (By 'x'.)

Aman Sir: Toh 5 * x karne se kya aana chahiye? (So what should we get by doing 5 * x?)

Kavya: 18 aana chahiye na. (It should be 18, right?) Accha haan. (Oh yes.) Idhar 5 multiply mein hai 'x' ke saath. Humko 'x' ki value nikalni hai na? Toh 'x' ko akela karna hota hai. 'x' ki value nikalni hai, bas humein is side 'x' dikhna chahiye. Toh 'x' ko akele karne ke liye 5 ko udhar bhagaye? 5 multiply mein hai, udhar jaake kya ho jayega uska opposite? (5 is in multiplication here with 'x'. We need to find the value of 'x', right? So 'x' has to be isolated. We need to find the value of 'x', we should just see 'x' on this side. So to isolate 'x', should we move 5 to the other side? 5 is in multiplication, what will it become on the other side, its opposite?)

Kavya: Divide.

Aman Sir: Toh 18 by 5. 5 3za 15. Bacha udhar 3. 3 ke aage zero lagaye, point laga kar. Ab 30 ho gaya woh. 5 kitne baar mein 30? (So 18 by 5. 5 3za 15. 3 is left there. We put a zero after 3, by putting a point. Now it has become 30. How many times is 5 into 30?)

Kavya: Six. 6.5.

Aman Sir: 3.6 ye aa gaya. (3.6 this came.)

Kavya: Main bol rahi thi na 3.5 ke near aayega. (I was telling you it would be near 3.5.)

Aman Sir: Toh ab dekho 8... ye 3.6 hai aur ye 4 hai. Toh ye length poora kitna hua? (So now look 8... this is 3.6 and this is 4. So what is the total length?)

Kavya: 7.6.

Aman Sir: Very good. Ab 7.6 ka kya se into karein ki 38 square cm aaye? Pata nahi na ye kya hai? Kya maan le ise? (Very good. Now what should 7.6 be multiplied by to get 38 square cm? We don't know what this is, right? What should we assume it as?)

Kavya: 'x'.

Aman Sir: Well done. Ab 7.6 * 4? (Well done. Now 7.6 * 4?)

Kavya: Nahi, * 'x'. (No, * 'x'.)

Aman Sir: = 4? ( = 4?)

Kavya: = 38.

Aman Sir: Kiska value nikalni hai? (Whose value do we need to find?)

Kavya: 'x' ki.

Aman Sir: Use kya karein? (What should we do with it?)

Kavya: Alag. (Separate.)

Aman Sir: Karo. Kar diya. Ye wala thoda sa hard hai. Karo. (Do it. Done. This one is a little hard. Do it.) Toh aise karna? Abhi toh seekhe na kaise karte hain? Kiski value nikalni hai? (So, do it like this? We just learned how to do it, right? Whose value do we need to find?) Mereko divide karna nahi aata decimal. (I don't know how to divide with decimals.)

Kavya: Nahi nahi, kiski... aap 38 ke saamne divide ka sign kyun laga rahe ho? Jo transfer hua hai uske saamne sign badlega na. 38 toh vaise ka vaise raha. 7.6 ke saamne divide ka sign lagega. Okay? Ab dekho kya karte hain. Kaise divide karte hain, theek hai? Decimal ho na, toh use hum na... decimal ko hatate hain. Decimal kaise hatega pata hai? Ek decimal hai na, use hatao. (No no, whose... why are you putting a division sign in front of 38? The sign of what is transferred will change, right? 38 remained as it is. A division sign will be put in front of 7.6. Okay? Now see what we do. How to divide, okay? When there's a decimal, then we... we remove the decimal. Do you know how the decimal is removed? There's one decimal, right, remove it.)

Aman Sir: Toh 10 aa jayega niche? (So 10 will come down?)

Kavya: Very good. Pata toh hai aapko. Ab ye solve karna mushkil dikh raha hai na? (Very good. You know it. Now this looks difficult to solve, right?)

Aman Sir: Nahi. Agar hum log isko 760 bana dete hain... (No. If we make this 760...)

Kavya: Kya bana de? (What should we make it?)

Aman Sir: 760.

Kavya: Toh phir niche 100 karna padega. Apne se badha toh nahi sakte na number ko. Agar isme 10 ka multiply kar rahe hain, toh niche bhi 10 ka multiply karna padega. Ye toh change kar diya humne. Divide hai, tension ho raha hai na divide karne mein? Socho 38/2 hota. Ye aisa rehta. 38/2? (Then we will have to make it 100 below. We can't increase the number on our own, right? If we are multiplying this by 10, then we will have to multiply below by 10 as well. We have changed this. It's division, it's tensing to divide, right? Imagine if it was 38/2. It would be like this. 38/2?)

Aman Sir: 19.

Kavya: Toh aasani se 19 aa jata. Lekin kyunki ye fraction hai toh dikkat ho raha hai. Toh divide ki jagah agar socho ye question aisa dikh raha hota aapko. Toh aasani hoti na humein? (So 19 would have come easily. But because this is a fraction, it's causing a problem. So instead of division, imagine if you were seeing this question like this. It would have been easy for us, right?)

Aman Sir: Haan. (Yes.)

Kavya: Toh divide ko multiply mein change kar do. Kaise hota hai pata hai? Divide kya mein change hua? Aur ye palat jata hai upar niche. 10 upar. (So change division to multiplication. Do you know how it's done? What did division change into?)

Aman Sir: Multiply mein. (Into multiplication.)

Kavya: Haan, reciprocal, representative, kuch bolte hai na... (Yes, reciprocal, representative, they call it something, right...)

Aman Sir: Haan. Ye change ho gaya? Ab isse aasan hai cancel out karna. (Yes. This has changed? Now it's easier to cancel this out.)

Kavya: 380 and 380/76. (380 and 380/76.)

Aman Sir: But ye kya ho raha hai na, aap number ko aur bada kar rahe ho. Main kahunga ise 10 aur 38 hi rehne do, aur aasan rahegi cheezein. Dekho ab kya lagta hai, divisibility check karo inki. 2 se jayenge dono? (But what's happening is that you are making the number even bigger. I would say let it be 10 and 38, things will be easier. Look now, what do you think, check their divisibility. Will both go by 2?)

Kavya: Haan. (Yes.)

Aman Sir: 2 se 38 kitne baar mein jayega? (How many times will 38 go by 2?)

Kavya: 19.

Aman Sir: 21 za aur 29 za hai na? Niche wale ko bhi 2 se cancel karna padega. Karo. (21 za and 29 za, right? We'll have to cancel the one below by 2 as well. Do it.)

Kavya: 3. And 8.

Aman Sir: Aur dekho kuch cancel ho raha hai aise hi? (And see if anything else is getting cancelled like this?) Jaise kya 38 ke table mein 10 aata hai? (Like, does 10 come in the table of 38?)

Kavya: Nahi.

Aman Sir: 38 ke table mein 19 aata hai? (Does 19 come in the table of 38?)

Kavya: Nahi.

Aman Sir: Kya 10 ke table mein 38 aata hai? (Does 38 come in the table of 10?)

Kavya: Nahi.

Aman Sir: Kya 19 ke table mein 38 aata hai? (Does 38 come in the table of 19?)

Kavya: Haan. (Yes.)

Aman Sir: Kitna? (How much?)

Kavya: 2.

Aman Sir: Toh? (So?)

Kavya: 191 za aur 192 za. (191 za and 192 za.)

Aman Sir: 10/2 bacha idhar? (Is 10/2 left here?)

Kavya: Haan. 20 aayega iska. (Yes. Its will be 20.)

Aman Sir: Very good. 10/2 kya ho jata hai? (Very good. What does 10/2 become?)

Kavya: 20.

Aman Sir: Aur 102 kya hota hai? (And what is 102?)

Kavya: 20.

Aman Sir: Well done. 10/2 bhi 20. 102 bhi 20. Kya baat hai! (Well done. 10/2 is also 20. 102 is also 20. Wow!) Aur 210 bhi 20. (And 210 is also 20.)

Kavya: 2/10... (2/10...)

Aman Sir: 2/10 bhi 20! Aisi hai na? Pakka? Kya mazak kar rahe ho? 10/2 kab se 20 hone laga? 10 chocolates hain use do log mein equal divide karenge. Kitne-kitne chocolates milenge? (2/10 is also 20! Is it like that? For sure? Are you kidding me? Since when did 10/2 start becoming 20? There are 10 chocolates, they will be divided equally between two people. How many chocolates will each get?)

Kavya: 5.

Aman Sir: Accha. 'x' = 5. Sab mein 'haan, hmm, 20, 20, 20'. Kitna ho gaya? 25 za? 25 za 5. 10. Toh 'x' kise maane the hum? Ise. Iski value kya aa gayi? 10 aa gayi. (Okay. 'x' = 5. In everything 'yes, hmm, 20, 20, 20'. How much did it become? 25 za? 25 za 5. 10. So who did we consider 'x'? This. What is its value?)

Kavya: 5 aayegi. (It will be 5.)

Aman Sir: Nahi, ab 7.610 karenge toh... 5 kyun aayegi? Accha 5 sorry. Haan. Toh ye 10 nahi kitna hua? 5. 7.65 karo. Ab kyun karna? Check karne ke liye aise hi sahi hai ki nahi 38 aa raha ki nahi. (No, now if we do 7.610 then... why will it be 5? Okay 5 sorry. Yes. So this is not 10, how much is it? 5. Do 7.65. Now why do it? Just to check if it's correct or not, if 38 is coming or not.)

Kavya: 76=... (76=...)

Aman Sir: 7.65. (7.65.)

Kavya: Kya? (What?)

Aman Sir: Ye 7.6 aaya aur ye 5 aaya. Ek baar check karte hai na multiply karke 38 aa raha hai ki nahi. (This came as 7.6 and this came as 5. Let's check once by multiplying if we are getting 38 or not.)

Kavya: Karo aap hi karo. Aap karo. Jaldi jaldi nahi toh mera rubber aapke side aa jayega phone ke. (You do it, you do it. You do it. Hurry up or my rubber will come to your side of the phone.)

Aman Sir: Kya? Mera rubber aapke side rakh doonga phone ke. (What? I will keep my rubber on your side of the phone.)

Kavya: Jaldi. (Quickly.)

Aman Sir: Are pencil toh utha lene do bina pencil ke kya karu. (Let me pick up the pencil, what will I do without it?)

Kavya: Jaldi pencil uthao nahi toh rubber mere phone ke upar rakh doonga. (Pick up the pencil quickly or I'll put the rubber on my phone.)

Aman Sir: Rakh do, aap hi ke phone ka nuksan aayega. (Put it, your phone will be damaged.)

Kavya: Toh ab main copy ke upar rakh doonga. (Then now I'll put it on the copy.)

Aman Sir: Rakh do. (Put it.) Ab aapke copy ka nuksan hoga. (Now your copy will be damaged.)

Kavya: Nahi hoyega. (It won't.)

Aman Sir: Main usko rakh deta hoon apne haath ke upar. (I'll put it on my hand.)

Kavya: Rakh do. Aap hi ke haath mein paseena aayega. (Put it. Your hand will sweat.)

Aman Sir: Toh phir main yahan rakh deta hoon. (Then I'll put it here.)

Kavya: Rakh do. Jaldi karo. (Put it. Do it quickly.) 5... 5 6za... Jaldi karo nahi toh class ab teen ghante ki lenge. (5... 5 6za... Do it quickly or I'll take the class for three hours now.)

Aman Sir: Haan. Abhi ab aaya dimaag. Rubber tak nahi aa raha tha. (Yes. Now the brain came. It wasn't even reaching the rubber.)

Kavya: 38.0. Haan aa gaya answer 38.0 matlab answer 38 hai. (38.0. Yes, the answer is 38.0, which means the answer is 38.) Okay. Done. Bye.
