### 👑 Full Verbatim Transcript: Kavya's Class (31-10-2025)

**Participants:**
* **Aman Sir (Tutor)**
* **Kavya (Student)**

*(The class begins with Kavya already present. There is a celebratory tone.)*

**Aman Sir:** ...celebration of me coming into the class early.
**Aman Sir:** Shall we start?
**Kavya:** I have written this... aur mereko kuch aur aa nahi raha tha, toh iske saath main yeh bhi likh di. (I have written this... and I couldn't think of anything else, so I wrote this along with it.)
**Aman Sir:** Okay.
**Kavya:** Aaj main sirf na summary nahi kar paayi. Quiz khel li par summary nahi kar paayi. (Today I just couldn't do the summary. I played the quiz, but I couldn't do the summary.)
**Aman Sir:** Summary means you did not do the activity you were saying?
**Kavya:** Yeah.
**Aman Sir:** What was the activity?
**Kavya:** Main read bhi nahi ki hoon. (I haven't even read it.)
**Aman Sir:** Okay, you did not read the...
**Kavya:** Wait, ek second. (Wait, one second.)

*(Kavya leaves the room and returns. Long pause.)*

**Aman Sir:** Tenses... aur? (Tenses... and what else?)
**Kavya:** Tenses.
**Aman Sir:** Um, first we'll revise some tenses, okay? And we'll... we'll do continuous tenses then. After that, we'll revise...
**Kavya:** Perfect continuous?
**Aman Sir:** No, no. Like, there are 12 tenses. Three we have done. Yeah? Three more we'll do today. After that, we'll revise the chapter "Colors of the Earth" from English. Okay? We'll revise it, we'll practice it, and then after that, we'll study science, the same chapter but from Curiosity today.
**Kavya:** Can we do tense today only?
**Aman Sir:** No, no, it... it's not right to do it.
**Kavya:** Please.
**Aman Sir:** No, like... it doesn't happen like that. It's wrong to teach tenses like that.
**Kavya:** No, means, can we do tenses only today?
**Aman Sir:** That's what I'm trying to say. Um, all tenses should never be done on the same day. Like, it should... there should be gap between all those for the brain to process. Yesterday we did all simple tenses. Today we'll do all continuous tenses.
**Aman Sir:** All continuous tenses will take just 5 to 10 minutes, that's it.
**Kavya:** More.
**Aman Sir:** What?
**Kavya:** Can we do perfect also?
**Aman Sir:** No, like... one should not teach like that. Because the brain needs to process. It's new for you.
**Kavya:** If there are 12 tenses, so how it took Anaya one month?
**Aman Sir:** There was very rigorous practice. Like, very rigorous practice. Not just sentence practice, but writing also. She used to write whole paragraphs, stories using those... those tenses. And I used to find errors. That's how she got really good. She beat her brother in the competition of English grammar. He's in class 10th. In Sarla Birla, Bangalore.
**Kavya:** Yeah, I know that.
**Aman Sir:** Because... he hasn't revised it... but that says that how good Anaya has gotten in grammar. Because of that. Because practice has been really good. It takes time. Like, we'll do...
**Kavya:** I think I was crying in the class.
**Aman Sir:** Why?
**Kavya:** Because Saksham left.
**Aman Sir:** Oh, okay.
**Kavya:** And she doesn't have anyone to fight now.
**Aman Sir:** (Laughs) Because they fight a lot.
**Kavya:** Why did you cancel her class today?
**Aman Sir:** Um, 'cause I could not go at that time. I was... somewhere else. I'll take her class tomorrow.
**Kavya:** I was feeling bad that we... I was prepared fully for the challenge today.
**Aman Sir:** Even I felt bad, definitely. Because... like... actually I did not sleep the whole night yesterday. So that kind of disturbed some things for me. But we'll definitely...
**Kavya:** Me too, night also. I slept at 12 o'clock and woke up at 5:30. Just 5 hour 30 minutes.
**Aman Sir:** I slept at... in the morning, at 8:30.
**Kavya:** Why?
**Aman Sir:** Yesterday it was... birthday of my friend, so... like, we were celebrating that.
**Aman Sir:** But, yeah. Your quiz will be there tomorrow. Don't worry about it. Definitely. And like, your quiz will also be there and I will take your class also tomorrow, one extra class. Okay?
**Kavya:** Why?
**Aman Sir:** Because... like... there have been so many gaps in your classes, so I think... I should cover that.
**Kavya:** You will have... haan haan... (Yes, yes...)
**Aman Sir:** It will really help you, remember.
**Kavya:** We can have, we can have.
**Aman Sir:** I'll take it in that time only when it will be convenient for you, don't worry. Okay?
**Aman Sir:** You should ask *me* to take classes. "Sir, please take class on this day also." So that *you* will be relaxed during your tests and exams. Okay? Because our classes are very relaxing, but those exams are not.
**Kavya:** Soon we are going to start PA3.
**Aman Sir:** Yeah. So that's why, like, be very prepared. So you'll be very relaxed.
**Kavya:** But I am confused. They are starting exams from 18 November. And before that, 11 November, 13 November are the Olympiads.
**Aman Sir:** Okay.
**Kavya:** So what should student prepare for? Their Olympiad or for their exam?
**Aman Sir:** Definitely, yeah.
**Kavya:** And maybe Olympiads can be postponed because one Olympiad was on 24th of November. In between exams. So surely the Olympiads will postpone.
**Aman Sir:** And tenses are coming in your exam also. Okay? Grammar should never be learned in one go. Like, it should be learned in chunks.
**Kavya:** We have... have, had... have, has...
**Aman Sir:** ...for example, like, today's some tenses, tomorrow's some things...
**Kavya:** Have, had ki table, be form ki table... (The table for 'have/had', the table for 'be' form...)
**Aman Sir:** ...Verb form ki table? (Verb form table?)
**Kavya:** ...aur present, past, future ki matching table banaaiye. Par main kal... kal sirf absent hui aur ma'am itna saara karwa di English mein. (..and she made a matching table for present, past, future. But I... I was just absent yesterday and ma'am got so much done in English.)
**Aman Sir:** Koi baat nahi. I'll also give you a printed version of some verb forms that I gave Anaya. Okay? I'll give you a printout of that.
**Kavya:** Anaya mereko bata rahi thi, "Sir toh mereko poora print karke de diye the." bol rahi thi Anaya. (Anaya was telling me, "Sir gave me a full printout," Anaya was saying.)
**Aman Sir:** Yeah. I'll give you that and that will also help you in the quiz.
**Kavya:** Sir mereko poora table print karke de diye the, bol rahi thi Anaya. (Sir gave me the whole table printed, Anaya was saying.)
**Aman Sir:** Chalo. Toh hum fataak se revise karte hain jo tenses humne kal padhe. Uske baad hum continuous ko karenge. Fir kis mein chale jaayenge? (Okay. So let's quickly revise the tenses we learned yesterday. After that, we'll do continuous. Then where will we go?)
**Kavya:** English.
**Aman Sir:** English mein. Thoda sa usko revise karenge. Fir ek-do... ek-do question uske... (Into English. We'll revise that a bit. Then one or two... one or two questions from that...)
**Kavya:** Nahi, English mein bilkul nahi mann hai. (No, I really don't feel like doing English.)
**Aman Sir:** Koi baat nahi. Thoda sa toh bas revise karna hai, thodi si main story bataaunga, do questions ko practice kar lene hain, that's it. Fir hum chale jaayenge science mein. (No problem. We just have to revise a little bit. I'll tell a short story, we'll practice two questions, that's it. Then we'll go to science.)
KAavya: Pakka? (Promise?)
**Aman Sir:** Pakka. Writing keval do question ki practice karni hai. (Promise. Only two questions of writing practice.)
**Aman Sir:** Baaki aise reading ek... one go mein kar lenge. Paanch-che... chaar-paanch toh questions hain usme. Easy sa chapter hai. Kuch bhi nahi hai usme toh. (The rest, we'll just read in one go. There are only five-six... four-five questions. It's an easy chapter. There's nothing to it.)
**Kavya:** (Hiccups)
**Aman Sir:** Usko revise karne mein lagega maximum 15 to 20 minutes. Theek hai? Fir chale jaayenge science mein. Thoda sa aaj revision ka din hai. Naye-naye topics abhi khatam ho rahe hain na, toh unhe revise bhi hame karna padega. (It will take 15 to 20 minutes max to revise it. Okay? Then we'll go to science. Today is a bit of a revision day. New topics are just getting finished, so we have to revise them too.)
**Kavya:** Aaj jo social science mein jo hamara chapter aaya tha na, Chapter Six, woh aaj chalu hua hai. (The chapter that was on our social science... Chapter Six, that started today.)
**Aman Sir:** Accha. Okay. Woh chalu ho jaata, par ma'am... Tuesday, Wednesday dono absent thi na SS... SST waali ma'am. (Oh. Okay. That would have started, but ma'am... she was absent on both Tuesday and Wednesday... the SST ma'am.)

### Revision & Streak Game

**Aman Sir:** Chalo, fir hum start karein revision jo humne kal padha uska? Yeh streak game pe hoga. Theek hai? Aur jab aap bol do na ki ab ho gaya, toh utne hi streak ke aapko XP points milenge. (Okay, so should we start the revision of what we learned yesterday? It'll be on the streak game. Okay? And when you say you're done, you'll get XP points for that streak.)
**Kavya:** Accha. (Okay.)
**Aman Sir:** Main poochte jaaunga Hindi mein sentences, aapko batane jaane hain. (I'll keep asking sentences in Hindi, you have to tell [the English].)
**Aman Sir:** Main khelti hoon. (I play.)
**Kavya:** I play.
**Aman Sir:** Woh khelti hai. (She plays.)
**Kavya:** She plays.
**Aman Sir:** Aap khelte ho. (You play.)
**Kavya:** You play.
**Aman Sir:** Main nahi khelti hoon. (I don't play.)
**Kavya:** I don't play.
**Aman Sir:** Woh nahi khelta hai. (He doesn't play.)
**Kavya:** **She doesn't play.** (Mistake - "She" for "He")
**Aman Sir:** Hum nahi khelte hain. (We don't play.)
**Kavya:** **We doesn't play.** (Mistake)
**Aman Sir:** Wrong. Yeh hota hai "We don't play." Doesn't aata hai sirf He, She, It ke saath... (Wrong. It's "We don't play." "Doesn't" only comes with He, She, It...)
**Kavya:** ...aur name. (..and name.)
**Aman Sir:** ...aur singular subject ke saath. Theek hai? (..and singular subject. Okay?)
**Aman Sir:** Do you want to keep this streak? (referring to the score)
**Kavya:** (Shakes head no)
**Aman Sir:** Main khelti hoon. (I play.)
**Kavya:** I play.
**Aman Sir:** Main nahi khelti hoon. (I don't play.)
**Kavya:** I don't play.
**Aman Sir:** Kya aap khelte ho? (Do you play?)
**Kavya:** Do you play?
**Aman Sir:** Main nahi khelti hoon. (I don't play.)
**Kavya:** **I doesn't play.** (Mistake)
**Aman Sir:** (Laughs) I doesn't play nahi hota hai. "I don't play" hota hai. (It's not "I doesn't play." It's "I don't play.")
**Aman Sir:** Kya aap khelte ho? (Do you play?)
**Kavya:** Do you play?
**Aman Sir:** Kya main nahi khelti hoon? (Do I not play?)
**Kavya:** **Do I not...**

**Kavya:** ...play?
**Aman Sir:** Main khelti hoon. (I play.)

**Aman Sir:** Kya aap khelte ho? (Do you play?)
**Kavya:** Do you play?
**Aman Sir:** Kya aap nahi khelte ho? (Do you not play?)
**Kavya:** Do you not play?
**Aman Sir:** Very nice. Aap kya khelte ho? (What do you play?)
**Kavya:** What do you play?
**Aman Sir:** Aap kahan khelte ho? (Where do you play?)
**Kavya:** Where do you play?
**Aman Sir:** Excellent. Maine cricket khela. (I played cricket.)
**Kavya:** I played cricket.
**Aman Sir:** Maine cricket nahi khela. (I didn't play cricket.)
**Kavya:** **I had not played cricket.** (Mistake)
**Aman Sir:** Had jo hai na, woh Past Perfect ka helping verb hai. Yeh toh Past Simple tense hai. Maine cricket nahi khela. Past Simple ka helping verb hota hai "Did". ('Had' is the helping verb for Past Perfect. This is Past Simple. I didn't play cricket. The helping verb for Past Simple is "Did".)
**Kavya:** I did not play cricket.
**Aman Sir:** Very good.
**Aman Sir:** Kya aapne cricket khela? (Did you play cricket?)

**Aman Sir:** Aapne kya nahi khela? (What did you not play?)
**Kavya:** What did you not play?
**Aman Sir:** Kya aapne cricket nahi khela? (Did you not play cricket?)
**Kavya:** **Did you don't play cricket?** (Mistake)
**Aman Sir:** Nahi. "Did you not play cricket?" (No. "Did you not play cricket?")
**Kavya:** Wohi toh boli. (That's what I said.)
**Aman Sir:** "Did you don't" bole. "Did you not" bolna hai. (You said "Did you don't." You have to say "Did you not.")
**Aman Sir:** Kya aapne padhaai nahi ki? (Did you not study?)
**Kavya:** Did you not study?
**Aman Sir:** Very good.
**Aman Sir:** Kya aapne class prepare nahi ki? (Did you not prepare the class?)
**Kavya:** Did you not prepare the class?
**Aman Sir:** Very nice. Main khelungi. (I will play.)

**Aman Sir:** Main nahi khelungi. (I will not play.)
**Kavya:** I will not play.

**Kavya:** What will you play?
**Aman Sir:** Aap kya nahi kheloge? (What will you not play?)
**Kavya:** What will you not play?
**Aman Sir:** Very nice.
**Aman Sir:** Ab round two start hoga. Ab aap mujhse poochenge Hindi mein sentences. Main answer dunga. Aapko galti find karni hai. Jitni galti find karoge utne points milenge. (Now round two will start. Now you will ask me sentences in Hindi. I will answer. You have to find the mistakes. You'll get points for every mistake you find.)
**Kavya:** Okay. (Hiccups)
**Aman Sir:** I think you should just drink water. Yeh... (These...)
**Kavya:** ...jaati hi nahi hai. (It doesn't go away.)
**Aman Sir:** It is... sound... it is sounding like some music. (Hiccup) (Hiccup) (Hiccup)

**Aman Sir:** Hmm.
**KMain... main khel rahi hoon.** (I am playing.)
**Aman Sir:** I will be playing game.
**Kavya:** I am playing.
**Aman Sir:** I am playing.
**Kavya:** Yeh present continuous ho jaayega. (This will be present continuous.)
**Aman Sir:** Achha, present continuous nahi padhe na? Theek hai. (Oh, we haven't studied present continuous, right? Okay.)
**Kavya:** Main game khelti hoon. (I play game.)
**Aman Sir:** I plays game.

**Kavya:** Main... (I...)
**Aman Sir:** You will have to find mistakes, you know? Like...
**Kavya:** Main game khelti hai. (I... plays game. - *Kavya makes a mistake in her own Hindi sentence*)
**Aman Sir:** (Laughs) "Main game khelti hai" nahi hota, "Main game khelti hoon." (It's not "Main game khelti hai," it's "Main game khelti hoon.")
**Kavya:** Main game khelti hoon. (I play game.)
**Aman Sir:** I play game.
**Kavya:** Main... (I...)
**Kavya:** Main... main... (I... I...)
**KNext sentence?**

**Aman Sir:** ...intricate patterns. Very good. How did Madhubani artists make colors naturally in the past?
**Kavya:** In the past, Madhubani artists made colors naturally by using natural resources such as leaves and flowers. They used to rub and squeeze the red leaves of **like a** creeper...
**Aman Sir:** ...of creeper-like plants...
**Kavya:** ...of creeper-like plants to extract colors. They use leaves as green color. They use the stems of Har... Har...

**Kavya:** ...aspects...
**Aman Sir:** ...of...

**Aman Sir:** Next question, "What are food miles?"
**Kavya:** Food miles... The distance travelled by food items from the place of its production to the consumer is called food miles. We must aim to minimize food miles and we should never waste food and only take as much as we can consume.
